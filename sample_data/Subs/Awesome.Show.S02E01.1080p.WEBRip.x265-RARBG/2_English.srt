1
00:00:01,877 --> 00:00:04,086
And we're in the final minute
of added time.

2
00:00:05,506 --> 00:00:09,218
AFC Richmond and Nottingham Forest are
level with two goals apiece.

3
00:00:10,344 --> 00:00:15,182
Obisanya switches play.
He finds Rojas, who has room.

4
00:00:15,265 --> 00:00:16,265
Oh!

5
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:20,729
And it's a penalty!

6
00:00:22,064 --> 00:00:25,776
A giant opportunity for the Greyhounds
to change their club's tide here.

7
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:27,110
Nice pass, Sam!

8
00:00:27,653 --> 00:00:28,654
Here we go, Dani!

9
00:00:28,737 --> 00:00:29,905
-Yeah! Yes!
-Nice, nice.

10
00:00:29,988 --> 00:00:34,034
Huge relief for Colin Hughes after
he was liable for Forest's equalizer.

11
00:00:35,536 --> 00:00:38,413
Richmond has started the season
with seven straight ties…

12
00:00:38,497 --> 00:00:40,749
and if this match ends in a draw,
they will tie the record,

13
00:00:40,832 --> 00:00:44,586
which is currently
a tie between Southampton and Swansea.

14
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:45,838
Chris, can you even imagine

15
00:00:45,921 --> 00:00:48,590
starting a season
with seven consecutive draws?

16
00:00:48,674 --> 00:00:50,133
I sure can, Arlo.

17
00:00:50,217 --> 00:00:53,220
And that's because I'm a right-brained
dominant with a knack for make-believe.

18
00:00:55,013 --> 00:00:56,640
Is it okay if I pray?

19
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:59,643
Yeah, of course. But to which god
and in what language, you know?

20
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:01,144
You could cross your fingers, make a wish.

21
00:01:01,228 --> 00:01:02,229
There you go.

22
00:01:03,856 --> 00:01:06,817
The Richmond faithful,
who've recently gone through so much,

23
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,194
still fervently behind their club.

24
00:01:10,153 --> 00:01:11,154
Keep on him.

25
00:01:14,032 --> 00:01:15,242
Go on. Yeah!

26
00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:19,538
And a hush falls over Nelson Road…

27
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:25,169
With the exception of
Richmond's venerable mascot,

28
00:01:25,252 --> 00:01:28,297
Earl Greyhound, howling his encouragement.

29
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:36,305
Will Dani Rojas deliver the good boy
their first win of the season?

30
00:01:36,388 --> 00:01:37,514
Please, please, please, please.

31
00:01:37,598 --> 00:01:38,765
Come on, Dani.

32
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,103
Football is life.

33
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:17,221
-Oh, no.
-Oh, my God.

34
00:02:17,304 --> 00:02:19,223
I promise that's not what I wished for.

35
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:46,792
That poor creature. It's so tragic.

36
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:48,085
Awful turn of events.

37
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:50,337
You don't think that people will hate us
because of it, do you?

38
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:51,839
Well, it was obviously
a horrible accident,

39
00:02:51,922 --> 00:02:54,091
but I guess that one perk of being
in a lower division now

40
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:56,468
is that not every game is televised.

41
00:02:56,552 --> 00:02:58,428
Yes, but, Higgins, the Internet.

42
00:02:58,929 --> 00:03:00,722
Oh, right, the goddamn Internet.

43
00:03:01,557 --> 00:03:03,016
Twitter is going bonkers. Look.

44
00:03:04,059 --> 00:03:06,812
Oh, God. Did we really make
Michael Jordan cry?

45
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:08,605
-Did you write a statement for Ted?
-Yeah, I did.

46
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:12,442
But then he said, "Now, don't you fret,
Boba Fett." He's got it covered.

47
00:03:12,526 --> 00:03:13,527
Okay.

48
00:03:14,486 --> 00:03:16,238
-Coach!
-All right, Marcus,

49
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:17,698
-what do you got for me?
-Coach Lasso,

50
00:03:17,781 --> 00:03:19,992
how are you feeling about
the team's efforts today?

51
00:03:20,075 --> 00:03:22,536
Well, I feel like everyone played
their hearts out, especially Sam.

52
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:23,829
Just gets better and better every game.

53
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:26,957
He's really helping us fill
that giant Roy Kent void, you know.

54
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,001
And how many more matches you think
can end in a draw

55
00:03:29,084 --> 00:03:30,252
before you hit the panic button?

56
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:33,297
Well, Marcus, there's two buttons
I never like to hit, all right?

57
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:34,631
And that's "panic" and "snooze."

58
00:03:34,715 --> 00:03:36,175
Who else?

59
00:03:36,258 --> 00:03:37,968
What about this fella right here?

60
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:41,388
-Trent Crimm--
-The Independent.

61
00:03:42,264 --> 00:03:46,435
I was wondering if you had any comments
on Earl, the dog Dani Rojas killed today.

62
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:51,023
Trent Crimm, bringing that heat.

63
00:03:55,903 --> 00:03:56,904
Yeah.

64
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:01,783
Well, when I was three years old,
I got attacked by our neighbor's dog.

65
00:04:02,326 --> 00:04:04,912
I-I don't remember it happening,
but my mother said it was pretty--

66
00:04:04,995 --> 00:04:06,205
pretty scary, you know.

67
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:10,125
I do remember being afraid of dogs
while growing up though.

68
00:04:10,209 --> 00:04:12,669
Like if I was at a friend's house
for a sleepover or something,

69
00:04:12,753 --> 00:04:16,173
they'd have to keep their family dog
outside, otherwise I'd bawl my eyes out.

70
00:04:18,716 --> 00:04:22,721
Then in high school, our neighbor,
Mr. Grady, well, his wife passed away.

71
00:04:23,722 --> 00:04:25,933
And he was real sad about that,
as you can imagine,

72
00:04:26,517 --> 00:04:29,520
and he just kinda stopped
taking care of their dog.

73
00:04:30,729 --> 00:04:32,898
Same one that bit me. His name was Hank.

74
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:38,570
And so I started looking after him,
you know.

75
00:04:38,654 --> 00:04:41,573
Feeding him, taking him on walks,
playing fetch, all that fun stuff.

76
00:04:42,658 --> 00:04:45,327
Eventually, Mr. Grady's son moved
his dad into a nursing home,

77
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:48,247
and he asked if I wanted to keep Hank,
and I was like, "Yeah. Heck, yeah."

78
00:04:49,623 --> 00:04:52,292
And then a year or so after that
we had to put Hank to sleep.

79
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,589
It's funny to think about
the things in your life…

80
00:04:58,507 --> 00:05:02,177
that can make you cry just knowing
that they existed,

81
00:05:02,261 --> 00:05:04,054
can then become
the same thing that make you cry

82
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:05,681
knowing that they're now gone.

83
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:12,855
I think those things come into our lives…

84
00:05:14,231 --> 00:05:16,191
to help us get from one place
to a better one.

85
00:05:19,945 --> 00:05:22,281
And I hope we helped Earl do just that.

86
00:05:23,574 --> 00:05:25,784
We gonna miss him around here
a whole bunch. Yeah.

87
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:33,083
And how's Dani doing?

88
00:05:33,792 --> 00:05:34,793
I haven't spoken with him yet,

89
00:05:34,877 --> 00:05:37,462
but I just hope he's not being
too hard on himself, you know.

90
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,176
He's been like this for 20 minutes.

91
00:05:45,637 --> 00:05:47,139
He's gonna use all the hot water.

92
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:49,558
-Yeah.
-Yeah, you're right.

93
00:06:01,612 --> 00:06:03,655
Hey, Dani. What ya doing?

94
00:06:04,656 --> 00:06:06,283
Washing the death off of me.

95
00:06:14,124 --> 00:06:16,543
Well, I-- I recommend
you use a little soap.

96
00:06:17,169 --> 00:06:20,547
Helps get the eternal rest out of those
tough-to-reach places, you know.

97
00:06:20,631 --> 00:06:21,882
Gracias, Coach.

98
00:06:23,258 --> 00:06:26,428
Well, hey, don't forget,
football is life, right?

99
00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:30,849
I know. It used to be.

100
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:37,105
I got nothing.

101
00:06:44,988 --> 00:06:46,615
Okay, so, fellas,

102
00:06:46,698 --> 00:06:49,284
let's go ahead and give Dani
a little bit of space right now, yeah?

103
00:06:49,368 --> 00:06:50,953
Y'all don't mind showering at home, do ya?

104
00:06:51,036 --> 00:06:52,663
Coach, if it's okay with you,

105
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:54,540
some of us prefer
to take long baths at home.

106
00:06:54,623 --> 00:06:56,542
Yeah, yeah.

107
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:58,252
Oh. Yeah, no, okay, that'll work too.

108
00:06:58,335 --> 00:07:00,671
Oh, and hey, way to play out there today.

109
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:02,381
Y'all kicked their butts
from soup to nuts.

110
00:07:02,464 --> 00:07:03,882
Don't worry, we gonna get a W soon.

111
00:07:04,716 --> 00:07:06,176
We'll see you goldfish on Monday.

112
00:07:06,844 --> 00:07:07,845
Goldfish?

113
00:07:07,928 --> 00:07:11,014
Oh, it means to forget our mistakes
and failures and just move on.

114
00:07:11,723 --> 00:07:14,560
But I didn't make any mistakes.
Only you played poorly.

115
00:07:17,312 --> 00:07:19,648
Hey, guys, Jan Maas is not being rude.

116
00:07:19,731 --> 00:07:20,732
He's just being Dutch.

117
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:23,902
-Yeah, yeah.
-True.

118
00:07:31,535 --> 00:07:33,704
I'm telling you,
all these ties are my fault.

119
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:36,623
It's straight up celestial payback
for the Man City game.

120
00:07:36,707 --> 00:07:39,626
There I was wishing and hoping
for a freaking tie,

121
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:41,295
and now the karma police are making good

122
00:07:41,378 --> 00:07:43,547
on showing me what I get
when I mess with them.

123
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:45,924
The team's playing well, Ted,
just a little unlucky, that's all.

124
00:07:46,008 --> 00:07:49,303
"Unlucky." Yeah. Man, I love the way
y'all use that word over here.

125
00:07:49,386 --> 00:07:51,805
Back home, if a team was playing poorly,
we don't call 'em unlucky.

126
00:07:51,889 --> 00:07:53,932
-What do we call 'em, Coach?
-New York Jets.

127
00:07:54,016 --> 00:07:55,642
-There it is.
-Hey, Coach.

128
00:07:55,726 --> 00:07:57,978
Sorry to interrupt.
Can I leave a little early today?

129
00:07:58,061 --> 00:08:00,480
But part of your job is to stay
until the whole team's gone.

130
00:08:00,564 --> 00:08:03,442
No, yes, of course. It's just,
it's my mum's 50th birthday--

131
00:08:03,525 --> 00:08:04,943
Oh. Oh.

132
00:08:05,027 --> 00:08:07,154
And what position does your mum play
on the team again?

133
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:11,325
It's okay, Will. Tell your mom
a happy birthday from all of us,

134
00:08:11,408 --> 00:08:13,619
and if she ever wants to try out
for the team, she's more than welcome.

135
00:08:13,702 --> 00:08:14,912
Lovely.

136
00:08:21,043 --> 00:08:22,294
You gotta stay on 'em.

137
00:08:23,086 --> 00:08:24,755
Pressure makes pearls, right?

138
00:08:26,215 --> 00:08:27,341
Wait, that's wrong.

139
00:08:27,424 --> 00:08:29,885
It's diamonds-- Shit! I messed it up.

140
00:08:29,968 --> 00:08:31,512
No, you didn't mess it up.
You were just--

141
00:08:31,595 --> 00:08:33,096
-Unlucky.
-Yes!

142
00:08:36,683 --> 00:08:37,893
Thanks.

143
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:39,645
That's odd.

144
00:08:39,727 --> 00:08:43,565
We just received a giant food delivery
from our rivals over at Brentford F.C.

145
00:08:43,649 --> 00:08:45,192
That's nice. What kind of food?

146
00:08:45,275 --> 00:08:46,276
Thai.

147
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:48,278
Oh, now I get it.

148
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:51,782
-Howdy, y'all.
-Ted!

149
00:08:52,407 --> 00:08:54,660
What do you say to a cocktail,
Coach Lasso?

150
00:08:54,743 --> 00:08:56,411
Oh, the same thing I'd say to Diane Sawyer

151
00:08:56,495 --> 00:08:58,413
if she ever asked me out on a date:
"Yes, please."

152
00:08:59,164 --> 00:09:02,376
Boy, oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy.

153
00:09:03,001 --> 00:09:03,961
How you feeling?

154
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:05,796
Well, Keeley, I feel like

155
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:08,215
a bigger loser than
the biggest loser from The Biggest Loser.

156
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:10,759
Oh, look on the bright side, Ted.

157
00:09:10,843 --> 00:09:13,011
We are still undefeated.

158
00:09:13,095 --> 00:09:14,555
Okay, sure. Thank you.

159
00:09:15,097 --> 00:09:16,098
How's Dani doing?

160
00:09:17,432 --> 00:09:19,059
Oh, he's a little shell-shocked,

161
00:09:19,142 --> 00:09:21,103
but Dani's a lot like
an expensive tape measure.

162
00:09:21,186 --> 00:09:23,313
-He snaps back real quick.
-Yeah.

163
00:09:23,397 --> 00:09:24,815
What about Earl's owner?
He doing all right?

164
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:26,859
-Yeah, fortunately he is.
-Oh, good.

165
00:09:26,942 --> 00:09:29,570
Yes, and you're now looking at
the very new, very generous,

166
00:09:29,653 --> 00:09:33,824
very guilt-riddled benefactor
of Richmond's largest dog shelter.

167
00:09:34,324 --> 00:09:35,534
Barkingham Palace.

168
00:09:36,618 --> 00:09:37,870
It's a good name.

169
00:09:38,537 --> 00:09:40,289
-To Earl.
-To Earl.

170
00:09:40,372 --> 00:09:41,623
To Earl.

171
00:09:42,457 --> 00:09:44,001
Okay, I should go.

172
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:46,753
I promised the boys we'd watch
Empire Strikes Back tonight,

173
00:09:46,837 --> 00:09:48,547
and I have to get my thoughts together

174
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:51,008
for when they ask
about Luke and Leia making out.

175
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:53,135
-Oh, right.
-Wish me luck.

176
00:09:53,218 --> 00:09:54,469
Good luck, Higgins.

177
00:09:54,553 --> 00:09:55,596
Bye, Leslie.

178
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:58,432
-Hey. May the force be with you.
-And also with you.

179
00:09:58,515 --> 00:09:59,516
All right.

180
00:10:00,267 --> 00:10:02,186
-Oh, my God!
-Oh, is that him?

181
00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:03,812
-Yes, yes, yes.
-Come on! Oh, good!

182
00:10:04,897 --> 00:10:06,148
Okay.

183
00:10:06,231 --> 00:10:07,524
Hey, him who?

184
00:10:08,483 --> 00:10:10,402
-And?
-Well, I mean…

185
00:10:10,485 --> 00:10:12,654
-Okay, but?
-Oh, no. Totally.

186
00:10:12,738 --> 00:10:14,489
-Good, I'm proud of you.
-Thanks.

187
00:10:14,573 --> 00:10:15,866
Am I allowed to speak yet?

188
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:18,744
Oh, sorry, Ted.
It's just a little bit of girl talk

189
00:10:18,827 --> 00:10:22,247
about a gentleman suitor
I've gone out with a few times.

190
00:10:22,331 --> 00:10:25,083
Nice. A little girl talk. I get it.

191
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:27,002
What's his name--

192
00:10:30,672 --> 00:10:33,300
Are you guys up for a double date
next week? Let him prove his mettle.

193
00:10:33,383 --> 00:10:36,094
-Abso-fucking-lutely.
-Can you ask Roy if he's free?

194
00:10:36,178 --> 00:10:37,429
-He's free. Don't worry.
-Okay, cool.

195
00:10:37,513 --> 00:10:39,223
Hey, did Roy come to the game today?

196
00:10:39,806 --> 00:10:41,433
Oh, no, he didn't. Sorry, Ted.

197
00:10:41,517 --> 00:10:43,894
Oh, no, that's okay. I'm sure
he'll swing by at some point, right?

198
00:10:44,561 --> 00:10:47,022
Hey, he knows he's always got a ticket
waiting for him at will call, yeah?

199
00:10:47,105 --> 00:10:48,106
-Yeah.
-Good, okay.

200
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:50,859
And don't forget,
I don't put it under his name.

201
00:10:50,943 --> 00:10:52,903
I don't want folks messing with him.
It's under an alias.

202
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:56,406
Like, last week it was
Loretta Lynn, this week was Dolly Parton,

203
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:59,117
and next week is, if I remember correctly,
Shania Twain.

204
00:10:59,201 --> 00:11:00,369
Just brilliant.

205
00:11:00,452 --> 00:11:01,537
And it's nothing personal.

206
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:03,914
It's just that he's been so busy
with this new coaching gig.

207
00:11:05,249 --> 00:11:06,291
You listen to me!

208
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:10,337
You play like that next week,
you can kiss the trophy goodbye,

209
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:14,550
'cause today, you all played like
a bunch of little pricks!

210
00:11:14,633 --> 00:11:15,634
You hear me?

211
00:11:15,717 --> 00:11:17,344
Yes, Coach!

212
00:11:17,427 --> 00:11:20,389
Except for Kokoruda. Way to put
your body on the line out there.

213
00:11:20,472 --> 00:11:22,391
You know it, Coach.

214
00:11:22,474 --> 00:11:25,310
All right,
Monika's mum brought orange slices.

215
00:11:25,394 --> 00:11:27,396
Don't eat the peels, you animals.
Off you go.

216
00:11:28,021 --> 00:11:30,065
-Keeley!
-Hey, Phoebs!

217
00:11:31,525 --> 00:11:33,944
Coach Kent. They're eight years old.

218
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:36,655
-You can't call them little pricks.
-Sorry, Ms. Bowen.

219
00:11:36,738 --> 00:11:38,365
Even when they're being little pricks.

220
00:11:38,448 --> 00:11:40,242
See you on Monday at school, girls.

221
00:11:40,325 --> 00:11:41,952
-Bye, Ms. Bowen.
-Hey, babe.

222
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:43,036
Bye, Ms. Bowen.

223
00:11:44,246 --> 00:11:46,331
-All right, who wants some hot chocolate?
-Me!

224
00:11:46,415 --> 00:11:48,208
-I do.
-Yeah, let's go!

225
00:11:53,088 --> 00:11:54,673
Oh! Before I forget,

226
00:11:54,756 --> 00:11:57,176
Rebecca wanted to see if we could do
some double date action next week.

227
00:11:57,259 --> 00:11:58,635
Fucking hell.

228
00:11:58,719 --> 00:12:01,972
Bad word, Uncle Roy. You owe me one quid.

229
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:03,223
Put it on my tab.

230
00:12:03,807 --> 00:12:05,350
-Can you hold this, please?
-Course.

231
00:12:05,893 --> 00:12:07,102
Come on. It'll be fun.

232
00:12:08,687 --> 00:12:10,564
-Fine.
-Thank you.

233
00:12:12,691 --> 00:12:14,193
Phoebe, how was the match today?

234
00:12:14,735 --> 00:12:16,320
-Outstanding.
-Yeah?

235
00:12:16,403 --> 00:12:18,906
I got a red card
for elbowing a girl in her neck.

236
00:12:19,615 --> 00:12:20,908
And I'm very proud.

237
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:23,493
What?

238
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:28,040
Well, I know that you guys
are just gonna smash it next week.

239
00:12:28,123 --> 00:12:29,499
Me too.

240
00:12:30,459 --> 00:12:31,877
So once the season's over,

241
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,545
you're gonna have more time
to see some friends, right?

242
00:12:34,129 --> 00:12:35,339
I see friends all the time.

243
00:12:35,422 --> 00:12:36,715
I know. You got your yoga mums.

244
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:40,844
Don't you ever want anything more than
sitting in child's pose,

245
00:12:40,928 --> 00:12:43,305
getting buzzed on rosé,
and gossiping about reality TV

246
00:12:43,388 --> 00:12:45,432
with a bunch of women
that know nothing about you?

247
00:12:45,516 --> 00:12:47,226
No, I love it.

248
00:12:50,812 --> 00:12:52,314
Sky Sports reached out again.

249
00:12:52,397 --> 00:12:53,565
No.

250
00:12:53,649 --> 00:12:54,650
I think it's a good idea.

251
00:12:54,733 --> 00:12:58,487
Last time I did one of your good ideas,
I made a fucking fool of myself.

252
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:02,783
Your retirement press conference was
beautiful, Roy. People loved it.

253
00:13:02,866 --> 00:13:04,493
It got, like, 15 million views.

254
00:13:04,576 --> 00:13:07,871
Wait, so your way of alleviating
my embarrassment is to tell me

255
00:13:07,955 --> 00:13:10,457
how many millions of people have
seen me look like a knob?

256
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:12,876
Good point.

257
00:13:13,669 --> 00:13:16,463
I just wanna go on record saying that
I think you'd be an amazing pundit.

258
00:13:16,547 --> 00:13:18,715
I don't wanna be
a fucking football pundit,

259
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:20,717
sat on fucking telly
in a dumb fucking suit

260
00:13:20,801 --> 00:13:22,010
like a know-it-all twat.

261
00:13:22,094 --> 00:13:23,846
It's a shit job for shit people.

262
00:13:23,929 --> 00:13:27,307
I'd rather shit out my own fucking mouth
than do that fucking shit.

263
00:13:28,433 --> 00:13:29,434
Got it.

264
00:13:30,185 --> 00:13:31,478
Phoebs, where we at now?

265
00:13:32,062 --> 00:13:35,941
£1,236.

266
00:13:37,067 --> 00:13:38,068
Impressive.

267
00:13:39,945 --> 00:13:42,030
And it's déjà vu all over again

268
00:13:42,114 --> 00:13:46,118
as Dani Rojas has
another injury-time penalty kick

269
00:13:46,201 --> 00:13:49,663
to put Richmond in the win column
for the first time this season.

270
00:13:51,123 --> 00:13:53,959
If he can get it past
this adorable goalkeeper.

271
00:13:57,546 --> 00:14:02,134
Oh, gamesmanship from the keeper.
How will Rojas respond?

272
00:14:12,144 --> 00:14:15,063
Football is death!

273
00:14:20,444 --> 00:14:21,445
Oh, come in.

274
00:14:21,528 --> 00:14:22,613
Morning, boss.

275
00:14:22,696 --> 00:14:23,864
Oh, hi, Ted.

276
00:14:24,698 --> 00:14:27,451
Yikes. I haven't seen someone
that disappointed to see me

277
00:14:27,534 --> 00:14:30,245
since I wore a red baseball cap
to a Planned Parenthood fundraiser.

278
00:14:31,121 --> 00:14:34,917
Sorry, Ted. You're right.
I-- I was just hoping you were Keeley.

279
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,461
That's okay. I wish I was Keeley
three, four times a day.

280
00:14:37,544 --> 00:14:38,754
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

281
00:14:38,837 --> 00:14:41,173
Let me guess. You got a fever for
the flavor of a little girl talk?

282
00:14:42,382 --> 00:14:44,426
Well, shoot,
why don't you let me take a crack at it?

283
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:45,844
-Really?
-Yeah, why not?

284
00:14:45,928 --> 00:14:47,804
Oh. Okay, what the hell.

285
00:14:47,888 --> 00:14:50,349
So this chap I've been seeing, John.

286
00:14:50,432 --> 00:14:51,642
Stamos?

287
00:14:52,142 --> 00:14:54,102
No, his name's John Wingsnight.

288
00:14:54,186 --> 00:14:55,187
-Okay.
-But that's not the point.

289
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:57,564
Now hold on a second.
His name's John Wingsnight?

290
00:14:57,648 --> 00:14:58,982
-Yes.
-Like at a sports bar?

291
00:14:59,066 --> 00:15:01,235
Like, "Monday night's wings night
down at PJ Flatts," like that?

292
00:15:01,318 --> 00:15:03,111
Ted, would you please stop?

293
00:15:03,195 --> 00:15:05,489
Rule number one:
Even though it's called "girl talk,"

294
00:15:05,572 --> 00:15:07,533
sometimes it needs to be
more like, "Girl, listen."

295
00:15:07,616 --> 00:15:10,118
Got it. Learning on the fly here.
Come on. Hit me.

296
00:15:10,202 --> 00:15:14,790
All right, thank you. So, John,
I mean-- I mean, he's a wonderful man.

297
00:15:15,666 --> 00:15:18,418
-He's very handsome, successful.
-Nice.

298
00:15:18,502 --> 00:15:20,337
-Not shy.
-Is he nice to you?

299
00:15:21,296 --> 00:15:23,674
Yes. Yes, very.

300
00:15:23,757 --> 00:15:25,843
Good. Yeah, he sounds great.

301
00:15:25,926 --> 00:15:27,719
So I'm confused. Is there a problem here?

302
00:15:27,803 --> 00:15:28,804
Well…

303
00:15:31,056 --> 00:15:32,266
Actually, I suppose not.

304
00:15:33,225 --> 00:15:34,226
Okay.

305
00:15:34,935 --> 00:15:36,770
Okay, so rule number two is

306
00:15:36,854 --> 00:15:39,857
sometimes girl talk can just be
blabbing away about stuff,

307
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:42,734
and nothing has to really change,
and no one has to solve anything?

308
00:15:42,818 --> 00:15:43,944
Yeah, that's exactly right.

309
00:15:44,027 --> 00:15:45,362
I love it. Let's keep going.

310
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:47,447
Right, so… Come.

311
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:50,075
Okay.

312
00:15:51,493 --> 00:15:52,870
Hey, sorry I'm late, fellas.

313
00:15:52,953 --> 00:15:55,455
I was helping the boss pick out
a nail polish color for her date tonight.

314
00:15:55,539 --> 00:15:57,666
My favorite's the blue,
but I think they all kinda rock.

315
00:15:57,749 --> 00:15:59,084
What do guys you think?

316
00:16:00,002 --> 00:16:02,254
-What's wrong?
-We got a situation, Coach.

317
00:16:02,337 --> 00:16:04,423
He's underselling.
We have a Shakespearean fucking tragedy.

318
00:16:04,506 --> 00:16:05,716
Take it easy, Dani.

319
00:16:05,799 --> 00:16:08,051
Come on, Dani. One more time, yeah?
Have another go.

320
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,346
Come on, Dani. Come on.

321
00:16:22,024 --> 00:16:23,025
How many has he missed?

322
00:16:23,567 --> 00:16:24,568
All of them.

323
00:16:25,319 --> 00:16:27,362
Oh, boy. Okay. Hey, Dani!

324
00:16:28,405 --> 00:16:30,032
Come on, son. Let's take a walk.

325
00:16:31,366 --> 00:16:33,660
Wow. We're watching
the end of someone's career.

326
00:16:33,744 --> 00:16:34,745
Not now, Jan.

327
00:16:36,163 --> 00:16:38,999
-Sorry, Coach.
-No, no need to apologize.

328
00:16:39,082 --> 00:16:44,129
Dani, what happened between you and Earl,
that wasn't your fault, you know.

329
00:16:44,671 --> 00:16:47,633
You suffered an unlikely
and tragic coincidence.

330
00:16:48,175 --> 00:16:49,676
Not too dissimilar from those seen

331
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:52,596
throughout Paul Thomas Anderson's
1999 opus, Magnolia.

332
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:55,766
Is that Tom Cruise
with a little, tiny ponytail?

333
00:16:55,849 --> 00:16:58,352
No, Dani. I think you're thinking about
The Last Samurai.

334
00:16:58,435 --> 00:17:00,562
He's got a little, tiny ponytail
in Magnolia too, Coach.

335
00:17:00,646 --> 00:17:01,772
Oh, thank you, Coach.

336
00:17:01,855 --> 00:17:03,357
My apologies, Dani.

337
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,068
Tom Cruise was rocking a little,
tiny ponytail in both those films.

338
00:17:06,151 --> 00:17:07,528
-Okay.
-Point is,

339
00:17:07,611 --> 00:17:09,613
it's a tragic occurrence, all right?

340
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:11,949
A one-time thing.

341
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:14,742
So let's get away from the bad mojo
coming off that penalty box and,

342
00:17:14,826 --> 00:17:16,078
you know, have some fun.

343
00:17:16,161 --> 00:17:17,788
Let's kick some corners, right?

344
00:17:17,871 --> 00:17:18,872
-Right.
-Yeah?

345
00:17:18,955 --> 00:17:21,375
Hey, fellas! Line up for Midnight Poutine!

346
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:24,711
Yeah, there we go.
Help you get your feel back.

347
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:30,425
-All right, Dani.
-Okay, Coach.

348
00:17:30,509 --> 00:17:32,177
Take a deep breath, yeah?

349
00:17:32,803 --> 00:17:34,513
I want you to picture the shot.

350
00:17:35,973 --> 00:17:38,392
Be the ball, Dani. Now kick it.

351
00:17:45,107 --> 00:17:46,149
Oh, boy.

352
00:17:46,233 --> 00:17:48,026
That's all right. That's all right.

353
00:17:49,319 --> 00:17:53,240
Well, fellas, I am more stumped than
Paul Bunyan's local forest, you know th--

354
00:17:53,323 --> 00:17:54,324
That hurt.

355
00:17:56,076 --> 00:17:57,327
Any ideas?

356
00:17:57,411 --> 00:18:00,622
If Dani needs motivation, we could always
just show him his goddamn paycheck.

357
00:18:02,416 --> 00:18:05,043
I mean, that's a tad aggressive, you know.

358
00:18:05,127 --> 00:18:07,462
But hey, I shouldn't bring
an umbrella to a brainstorm,

359
00:18:07,546 --> 00:18:08,964
so I appreciate
you getting the ball rolling, Nate.

360
00:18:09,047 --> 00:18:10,340
Yeah.

361
00:18:10,424 --> 00:18:12,843
Seems like the first thing we need to do
is define the issue, yeah?

362
00:18:12,926 --> 00:18:14,011
True that.

363
00:18:14,094 --> 00:18:15,971
I think we already know what it is,
don't we, Coach?

364
00:18:16,054 --> 00:18:17,431
What you talking about, Willis?

365
00:18:18,557 --> 00:18:20,267
Hey, you're not supposed
to say that out loud.

366
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:21,727
Which is why I wrote it down.

367
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:23,270
"The yips"?

368
00:18:24,897 --> 00:18:26,273
What are the yips?

369
00:18:26,356 --> 00:18:27,941
Are you kidding me, you two?

370
00:18:29,735 --> 00:18:31,820
We don't say the Y-word out loud,
you understand?

371
00:18:31,904 --> 00:18:33,697
It's like saying Macbeth in a theater,

372
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:35,532
or Voldemort at Hogwarts, or…

373
00:18:35,616 --> 00:18:37,201
-Soccer in England.
-Bingo.

374
00:18:38,076 --> 00:18:39,870
But what are the yips?

375
00:18:39,953 --> 00:18:41,413
It's when, just out of nowhere,

376
00:18:41,496 --> 00:18:44,583
an athlete suddenly can't do
the basic fundamentals of their sport.

377
00:18:44,666 --> 00:18:46,460
Yeah, you know,
like Chuck Knoblauch's throw to first,

378
00:18:46,543 --> 00:18:48,962
or Charles Barkley's golf swing.

379
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:51,632
You guys know what I mean.

380
00:18:53,634 --> 00:18:56,053
Sometimes being here is like
living in a foreign country.

381
00:18:56,136 --> 00:18:57,679
-You ever feel that way?
-Yeah.

382
00:18:57,763 --> 00:18:59,389
Ted, what are your thoughts on therapy?

383
00:19:01,767 --> 00:19:05,103
General apprehension and a modest
Midwestern skepticism. Why do you ask?

384
00:19:05,187 --> 00:19:07,606
Well, maybe we should
bring in a sports psychologist.

385
00:19:07,689 --> 00:19:10,901
I know a lot of other clubs have had
tremendous success with that.

386
00:19:12,611 --> 00:19:13,779
It's not a bad idea, Coach.

387
00:19:18,992 --> 00:19:19,993
Okay.

388
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:23,080
Yeah, hold on.

389
00:19:23,163 --> 00:19:26,792
Let me think here.
Let me get my thinking thing on, okay.

390
00:19:28,252 --> 00:19:29,294
Yeah, let's do it.

391
00:19:32,798 --> 00:19:36,134
And now, we're nose-to-nose with
one another, and half of me is thinking,

392
00:19:36,218 --> 00:19:37,886
"Just kick this jerk in the balls

393
00:19:37,970 --> 00:19:39,471
and when he bends over,
give him a knee to the nose

394
00:19:39,555 --> 00:19:41,682
and be done with it,
'cause screw this guy."

395
00:19:41,765 --> 00:19:44,393
And the other half of me is thinking,
"But it's Martin Short.

396
00:19:44,476 --> 00:19:46,144
You love Martin Short."

397
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:48,981
Well, the next thing you know,
this tiny American woman says,

398
00:19:49,064 --> 00:19:50,482
"Is that it?"

399
00:19:50,566 --> 00:19:53,443
And sure enough, there it was,
wedged between the couch cushions,

400
00:19:53,527 --> 00:19:55,696
-Martin Short's wallet.
-Martin Short's wallet.

401
00:19:55,779 --> 00:19:57,614
I mean, he didn't steal it.

402
00:19:57,698 --> 00:19:59,908
-No!
-Wow, that's insane.

403
00:19:59,992 --> 00:20:02,536
That's madness.
Could I get another one, please?

404
00:20:02,619 --> 00:20:05,664
God, I never knew that meet and greets
at Broadway shows could be

405
00:20:05,747 --> 00:20:07,708
such hotbeds for, like, almost violence.

406
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:10,919
Oh, big-time. But who cares about
Martin Short when you're sitting next to

407
00:20:11,003 --> 00:20:14,047
"He's here, he's there,
he's every-fucking-where, Roy Kent,"

408
00:20:14,131 --> 00:20:16,258
-Roy Kent!
-John's football-mad.

409
00:20:16,341 --> 00:20:18,927
Oh, terrific. Who do you support?

410
00:20:19,011 --> 00:20:21,388
Well, I bounce back and forward
between United and City.

411
00:20:21,471 --> 00:20:23,223
Whichever club's winning, typically.

412
00:20:23,307 --> 00:20:25,309
-I love it.
-Sounds like it.

413
00:20:25,392 --> 00:20:26,852
So, how's retirement, Roy?

414
00:20:26,935 --> 00:20:29,688
I mean, I can't imagine
how different your life must be now.

415
00:20:29,771 --> 00:20:31,231
You must miss it all like mad, yeah?

416
00:20:32,149 --> 00:20:33,442
I don't.

417
00:20:34,109 --> 00:20:35,444
So what are you doing now then?

418
00:20:35,527 --> 00:20:36,987
Oh, you know, busy, busy.

419
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:39,531
I'm actually doing a bit of coaching
at the moment.

420
00:20:39,615 --> 00:20:42,993
-I hadn't heard that. Fantastic.
-Yeah. We got a cup final next week.

421
00:20:43,076 --> 00:20:44,620
In October… W-What cup's that?

422
00:20:45,204 --> 00:20:46,914
West London under-nine girls.

423
00:20:48,332 --> 00:20:49,625
Can I get another one, please?

424
00:20:50,125 --> 00:20:52,586
He's actually had
an offer from Sky Sports to be a pundit.

425
00:20:52,669 --> 00:20:55,672
Oh, of course you have.
You'd be amazing at that job.

426
00:20:55,756 --> 00:20:57,049
I love that idea.

427
00:20:57,716 --> 00:21:00,344
I couldn't agree more.

428
00:21:01,053 --> 00:21:03,472
Can I just say that
your retirement speech was amazing.

429
00:21:03,555 --> 00:21:05,182
It's the first time
my father's forwarded me

430
00:21:05,265 --> 00:21:08,769
an e-mail in the last five years that
wasn't about the scourge of immigration.

431
00:21:08,852 --> 00:21:10,854
And that really meant a lot to me,
so thank you.

432
00:21:11,855 --> 00:21:13,065
Cheers.

433
00:21:13,148 --> 00:21:15,817
It must've been super weird
afterwards though, right?

434
00:21:15,901 --> 00:21:17,361
I'm gonna need two more of these, please.

435
00:21:22,533 --> 00:21:23,742
Here you go, gentlemen.

436
00:21:23,825 --> 00:21:24,826
-Thank you, Mae.
-Thanks, Mae.

437
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:26,828
Shame what happened to Earl.

438
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:29,665
Him and his owner, Nigel,
used to come in here all the time,

439
00:21:29,748 --> 00:21:32,167
till he started shitting and pissing
all over the place.

440
00:21:32,251 --> 00:21:34,086
Yeah.
Nah, that's pretty common with older dogs.

441
00:21:34,169 --> 00:21:35,629
No, I'm talking about Nigel.

442
00:21:37,923 --> 00:21:39,341
-To Earl.
-He was a good boy.

443
00:21:44,888 --> 00:21:48,141
Hey, Coach, can I get real a second?
Forget my meal a second?

444
00:21:48,225 --> 00:21:50,394
Put down your beer
and tell your buddy how you feel a second?

445
00:21:50,477 --> 00:21:52,896
-Yeah.
-Sure.

446
00:21:53,939 --> 00:21:58,277
Look, I'm all for whatever it takes
to help Dani get back to being a hundred.

447
00:21:58,861 --> 00:22:01,822
But this whole idea of bringing in
someone from the outside

448
00:22:01,905 --> 00:22:03,448
to help us get him there,

449
00:22:03,532 --> 00:22:05,158
I don't know, it just kinda
puts a little knot in my belly.

450
00:22:05,242 --> 00:22:06,243
I'm not sure why.

451
00:22:07,411 --> 00:22:09,830
Sounds like it might be
your favorite Gin Blossoms song.

452
00:22:09,913 --> 00:22:12,040
-"Follow You Down"?
-No, "Hey Jealousy."

453
00:22:12,124 --> 00:22:13,959
No, "Hey Jealousy" is their best song.

454
00:22:14,042 --> 00:22:16,128
My favorite song of theirs is
"Follow You Down."

455
00:22:16,211 --> 00:22:18,046
You don't know that story?

456
00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:19,423
Doesn't matter, but to your point,

457
00:22:19,506 --> 00:22:21,758
you know, I thought it might've been
that green-eyed monster too,

458
00:22:21,842 --> 00:22:24,011
but you know,
I think there's a part of me

459
00:22:24,094 --> 00:22:29,057
that just doesn't--
I don't know… trust therapists?

460
00:22:29,725 --> 00:22:30,726
And how come?

461
00:22:31,435 --> 00:22:34,062
Well, when Michelle and I did
couple's therapy,

462
00:22:34,146 --> 00:22:37,441
it was with this therapist she'd been
going to for a while, and…

463
00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:40,903
I just kinda felt like I was being
set up, you know.

464
00:22:41,737 --> 00:22:43,822
Like I was going in there
not to be listened to,

465
00:22:43,906 --> 00:22:47,326
but rather just to hear about
all the things I'd been doing wrong.

466
00:22:48,493 --> 00:22:50,579
And that's the only time
you've ever seen a therapist?

467
00:22:50,662 --> 00:22:52,206
Oh, yeah.

468
00:22:52,956 --> 00:22:55,209
Do you remember what you said when
I got dumped by that cruise ship dancer

469
00:22:55,292 --> 00:22:57,127
and swore I would never date
another dancer again?

470
00:22:57,211 --> 00:22:58,545
"Can I have your tap shoes?"

471
00:22:59,129 --> 00:23:01,173
"All people are different people."

472
00:23:02,549 --> 00:23:03,550
I said that?

473
00:23:06,512 --> 00:23:07,513
That's pretty good.

474
00:23:07,596 --> 00:23:08,597
Yeah.

475
00:23:09,264 --> 00:23:11,308
-You went out with another dancer though?
-Many.

476
00:23:13,352 --> 00:23:14,353
Too many.

477
00:23:16,522 --> 00:23:18,524
Sorry if I was prattling on too much
this evening.

478
00:23:18,607 --> 00:23:21,109
You were as charming as ever.

479
00:23:21,944 --> 00:23:23,779
You sure you don't wanna
come back to mine?

480
00:23:24,363 --> 00:23:25,572
Got an early morning, remember?

481
00:23:27,199 --> 00:23:30,244
Right. Yeah, well,
let me know if I passed the test.

482
00:23:31,286 --> 00:23:33,539
-Lunch later this week?
-Perfect.

483
00:23:37,042 --> 00:23:38,544
Night.

484
00:23:38,627 --> 00:23:39,878
Thank you.

485
00:23:39,962 --> 00:23:41,338
-See ya.
-Bye.

486
00:23:41,421 --> 00:23:42,631
Cheers.

487
00:23:48,345 --> 00:23:50,639
-Well?
-I think he's a really good match.

488
00:23:50,722 --> 00:23:54,101
I mean, he's age-appropriate,
financially appropriate.

489
00:23:54,184 --> 00:23:55,227
He's not shy.

490
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:57,896
-I love that about him.
-Totally.

491
00:23:57,980 --> 00:23:59,481
Fucking hell.

492
00:24:02,067 --> 00:24:03,360
Is there a problem?

493
00:24:04,444 --> 00:24:05,946
Tell the truth.

494
00:24:06,029 --> 00:24:08,073
He's fine. That's it.

495
00:24:08,156 --> 00:24:10,158
Nothing wrong with that,
most people are fine.

496
00:24:10,242 --> 00:24:13,412
But it's not about him. It's about
why the fuck you think he deserves you.

497
00:24:14,538 --> 00:24:17,958
You deserve someone who makes you
feel like you've been struck by lightning.

498
00:24:19,334 --> 00:24:21,044
Don't you dare settle for fine.

499
00:24:26,258 --> 00:24:27,926
Not that it's any of my business.

500
00:24:45,903 --> 00:24:50,782
435, 436, 437, 438, 439, 440--

501
00:24:50,866 --> 00:24:52,284
Higgins, look alive!

502
00:24:53,118 --> 00:24:54,620
Nuts.

503
00:24:54,703 --> 00:24:58,081
Sorry. I just wanted to introduce you
to Dr. Sharon Fieldstone.

504
00:24:58,165 --> 00:25:00,042
She's gonna be looking after Dani.

505
00:25:00,125 --> 00:25:03,003
This is Nathan, Coach Beard,
and Ted Lasso.

506
00:25:03,086 --> 00:25:04,505
Oh, you don't need to stand.

507
00:25:04,588 --> 00:25:06,465
But it makes it a lot easier to do this.

508
00:25:07,716 --> 00:25:09,468
It's nice to meet you

509
00:25:09,551 --> 00:25:11,220
It's nice to meet you

510
00:25:11,303 --> 00:25:14,181
Consider this song
Our way to greet you

511
00:25:14,264 --> 00:25:15,265
Hey!

512
00:25:17,684 --> 00:25:20,395
So I understand that Dani has developed
a case of the yips?

513
00:25:20,479 --> 00:25:21,939
Hey!

514
00:25:22,648 --> 00:25:25,067
Okay, that's two weird things in a row.
What's going on?

515
00:25:25,150 --> 00:25:27,569
Well, Doc, we don't like
using that word around here.

516
00:25:27,653 --> 00:25:28,654
Why?

517
00:25:30,197 --> 00:25:31,365
How do I…

518
00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:32,991
Why y'all looking at me?

519
00:25:33,075 --> 00:25:35,744
He's the one that knows everyth--
Oh, okay, all right. Well, Doc--

520
00:25:35,827 --> 00:25:37,120
Doctor.

521
00:25:37,829 --> 00:25:39,206
Right, yes, of course. Sorry.

522
00:25:39,289 --> 00:25:42,709
Doctor. It's a superstition.

523
00:25:43,544 --> 00:25:45,087
I see. Well, the yips…

524
00:25:47,673 --> 00:25:49,091
are not a superstition.

525
00:25:49,675 --> 00:25:50,843
They are a mental condition,

526
00:25:50,926 --> 00:25:53,762
one that can be fixed
with discipline, not denial.

527
00:25:53,846 --> 00:25:56,640
So, then, you're pretty confident
that you can help us out with Dani?

528
00:25:56,723 --> 00:25:58,058
Are you good at your job?

529
00:25:59,518 --> 00:26:00,394
I mean…

530
00:26:01,436 --> 00:26:02,521
Don't worry about them.

531
00:26:03,772 --> 00:26:06,441
Put all bullshit humility aside
and be honest with me.

532
00:26:06,525 --> 00:26:08,360
Are you good at your job? Yes or no?

533
00:26:09,653 --> 00:26:10,654
Yes.

534
00:26:10,737 --> 00:26:11,947
I believe you.

535
00:26:12,865 --> 00:26:16,076
Well, as good as you are at your job,
I'm twice as good at mine.

536
00:26:20,789 --> 00:26:22,541
-We're very lucky to have you.
-Thank you very much.

537
00:26:22,624 --> 00:26:24,209
-That's good to know.
-Thank you for coming here.

538
00:26:24,793 --> 00:26:27,004
Right, so where should I be conducting
my sessions?

539
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:31,425
Why don't I set you up
in my office, all right?

540
00:26:32,009 --> 00:26:35,470
Great. Nice meeting all of you
and sorry to have interrupted your game.

541
00:26:35,554 --> 00:26:36,555
What's your record?

542
00:26:36,638 --> 00:26:39,016
Oh, 1,236.

543
00:26:42,519 --> 00:26:43,770
Impressive.

544
00:26:52,404 --> 00:26:54,573
She seems fun.

545
00:26:59,578 --> 00:27:01,413
You're sure you're okay,
me using your office?

546
00:27:01,496 --> 00:27:02,706
Not just being polite?

547
00:27:02,789 --> 00:27:05,876
I-- It's probably a bit of both,
but I insist.

548
00:27:05,959 --> 00:27:08,170
-Thank you, Mr. Higgins.
-No problem.

549
00:27:13,217 --> 00:27:14,927
Hey, Doc… tor.

550
00:27:15,010 --> 00:27:16,595
This right here, this is Dani Rojas.

551
00:27:16,678 --> 00:27:19,223
Dani, this is Dr. Sharon Fieldstone.

552
00:27:19,306 --> 00:27:21,266
Nice to meet you, Dani. How you feeling?

553
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:22,768
Like a murderer.

554
00:27:23,393 --> 00:27:24,770
Please.

555
00:27:26,021 --> 00:27:27,022
You're all right.

556
00:27:28,315 --> 00:27:31,693
Yeah. Want me to stick around,
help you break the ice with Dani here?

557
00:27:31,777 --> 00:27:33,987
I think we'll be all right, Coach Lasso.
Thank you.

558
00:27:34,905 --> 00:27:36,532
Okay. Yeah.

559
00:27:45,374 --> 00:27:46,875
-You okay?
-Oh, yeah.

560
00:27:47,417 --> 00:27:49,419
This is gonna be perfect. Yeah.

561
00:27:52,673 --> 00:27:55,050
And remember, this is when tickets
to Stomp were tough to get.

562
00:27:55,133 --> 00:27:57,511
Anyway, this tall redhead pushes
in front of me,

563
00:27:57,594 --> 00:27:59,429
so I tap him on the shoulder,
he turns around and goes,

564
00:27:59,513 --> 00:28:01,598
"Is there a problem?"
I go, "Yeah, there's a problem."

565
00:28:01,682 --> 00:28:03,851
He goes, "It's all right. It's all right.
I know the choreographer."

566
00:28:03,934 --> 00:28:04,935
Guess who it was…

567
00:28:26,331 --> 00:28:27,499
Is everything okay, Rebecca?

568
00:28:31,670 --> 00:28:34,882
It's j--
Dating is so odd, isn't it?

569
00:28:34,965 --> 00:28:37,843
-Yeah.
-I mean, we are all strangers essentially.

570
00:28:37,926 --> 00:28:41,722
So I mean, how is it ever possible
to truly feel safe with someone?

571
00:28:41,805 --> 00:28:42,806
I suppose you can't.

572
00:28:42,890 --> 00:28:45,267
You know, my friend, Flo, once told me

573
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:49,730
that intimacy was all about
leaving yourself open to being attacked.

574
00:28:50,522 --> 00:28:52,274
-Oh.
-Isn't that horrible?

575
00:28:52,357 --> 00:28:53,692
I've not heard that one.

576
00:28:53,775 --> 00:28:56,737
But I mean, it does make you realize
how scary it is,

577
00:28:57,946 --> 00:28:59,656
allowing yourself to be intimate again.

578
00:29:01,033 --> 00:29:02,743
I mean, you really do have to be brave.

579
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:08,665
And that's it right there, isn't it?

580
00:29:10,626 --> 00:29:12,836
I need to be brave enough to let someone…

581
00:29:14,755 --> 00:29:16,924
wonderful love me,

582
00:29:17,007 --> 00:29:20,093
without fear of being hurt
and without fear of being…

583
00:29:22,054 --> 00:29:23,055
safe.

584
00:29:26,433 --> 00:29:28,810
Sorry… Are you breaking up with me?

585
00:29:33,148 --> 00:29:36,735
I'm so sorry.
I-- I actually didn't know I was

586
00:29:36,818 --> 00:29:39,029
-going to do that--
-No, no, it's-- it's all right.

587
00:29:45,410 --> 00:29:46,495
Coffees are on me.

588
00:29:47,079 --> 00:29:49,790
Yeah, fair enough. Cheers.

589
00:29:59,633 --> 00:30:03,011
Dani Rojas, Rojas. Dani Rojas.

590
00:30:03,095 --> 00:30:05,138
Hello, my beautiful coaches.
May I join the drill?

591
00:30:05,222 --> 00:30:06,431
Sure thing, Dani, yeah.

592
00:30:06,515 --> 00:30:08,350
But hey, you take this
at your own pace, okay?

593
00:30:08,433 --> 00:30:09,434
You got it, Coach.

594
00:30:21,196 --> 00:30:22,322
Did she not wave back?

595
00:30:22,406 --> 00:30:24,658
-Oh, I don't think she saw me.
-She saw you.

596
00:31:10,204 --> 00:31:11,413
Hey, all right!

597
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:20,672
Hey, they got a whole bunch
of new emojis on here. You see this?

598
00:31:20,756 --> 00:31:22,925
Do you remember when they added
Groucho but no Harpo?

599
00:31:23,008 --> 00:31:24,426
It's bullshit.

600
00:31:25,093 --> 00:31:29,306
Good night, coaches, and thank you
for Dr. Sharon. She's incredible.

601
00:31:29,389 --> 00:31:31,558
No problem, Dani.
Just glad you're feeling better.

602
00:31:32,726 --> 00:31:35,437
Yeah, but hold on a sec.
I'm just curious.

603
00:31:35,521 --> 00:31:38,232
What did she-- I mean,
what ended up helping you?

604
00:31:39,608 --> 00:31:40,984
Dr. Sharon helped me remember that

605
00:31:41,068 --> 00:31:44,446
even though football is life,
football is also death.

606
00:31:45,989 --> 00:31:47,824
And that football is football too.

607
00:31:49,326 --> 00:31:50,869
But mostly that football is life!

608
00:31:51,703 --> 00:31:52,704
Yeah.

609
00:31:55,457 --> 00:31:57,084
Yeah, well, there you have it.

610
00:31:58,377 --> 00:32:01,255
You know what, I'm gonna go upstairs,
thank the good doc before she splits.

611
00:32:01,922 --> 00:32:03,423
It's the least you can do.

612
00:32:04,049 --> 00:32:05,342
Hey, Higgins. Doc still here?

613
00:32:05,425 --> 00:32:07,219
Oh, wait, Ted. She's in a session.

614
00:32:07,302 --> 00:32:08,470
A session? With who?

615
00:32:10,055 --> 00:32:12,891
-Thank you, Sharon. For real.
-You're welcome.

616
00:32:13,642 --> 00:32:14,643
She's amazing.

617
00:32:15,644 --> 00:32:18,397
-Thierry?
-Oh, yes. Hi.

618
00:32:24,444 --> 00:32:27,447
A few of the boys asked to sit down
with Dr. Fieldstone before she left.

619
00:32:27,531 --> 00:32:28,615
I don't see the harm, right?

620
00:32:29,199 --> 00:32:31,118
No, that-- That's great. Yeah.

621
00:32:35,998 --> 00:32:38,959
-Hi.
-Hey, gorgeous. What's going on?

622
00:32:39,042 --> 00:32:40,294
I feel like a little shit.

623
00:32:40,794 --> 00:32:43,422
I used our fun night out together
to try and change your mind

624
00:32:43,505 --> 00:32:45,382
about something you don't wanna do.

625
00:32:45,465 --> 00:32:47,634
That was tacky,
and I'm really sorry for it.

626
00:32:47,718 --> 00:32:49,678
You're very sweet. Thank you.

627
00:32:49,761 --> 00:32:51,263
I'm leaving work right now.

628
00:32:51,346 --> 00:32:54,224
I can stop by Waitrose,
pick up a bottle of wine, bring it over?

629
00:32:54,308 --> 00:32:57,269
Waitrose, is it?
Who am I talking to, the fucking queen?

630
00:32:57,978 --> 00:32:59,438
I'd love to, but…

631
00:32:59,521 --> 00:33:01,315
Oh, fuck! Yeah, it's yoga mums night.
Sorry.

632
00:33:01,398 --> 00:33:04,109
Yeah, but you can
beg for forgiveness later.

633
00:33:04,193 --> 00:33:05,611
I can swing by and wake you up.

634
00:33:05,694 --> 00:33:08,488
Roy. Hurry up. It's about to start.

635
00:33:09,323 --> 00:33:11,408
I'll be awake. Have fun, yeah?

636
00:33:11,491 --> 00:33:12,492
Bye, babe.

637
00:33:14,703 --> 00:33:16,038
Let's fucking do this.

638
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:20,667
Who will be eliminated this week

639
00:33:20,751 --> 00:33:24,463
on the UK's number one show,
Lust Conquers All?

640
00:33:24,546 --> 00:33:27,966
Will it be Grimsby's
top makeup counter associate, Ellie?

641
00:33:28,050 --> 00:33:31,470
Can't vote me off, yeah?
I'm the one who makes your lips tick.

642
00:33:31,553 --> 00:33:33,388
Oh, shut up, you slag.

643
00:33:33,472 --> 00:33:35,265
Come on. She's hilarious.

644
00:33:35,349 --> 00:33:38,185
Or will it be the footballing tart, Jamie?

645
00:33:42,231 --> 00:33:44,691
You can't get rid of me.
I'm the island's top scorer.

646
00:33:45,859 --> 00:33:46,860
Sexually.

647
00:33:49,238 --> 00:33:50,989
God, I love him.

648
00:33:51,073 --> 00:33:52,199
Oh, same.

649
00:33:53,075 --> 00:33:55,410
-Jesus.
-Top up my rosé please, Janice?

650
00:33:55,494 --> 00:33:57,162
…pharmacist from Borehamwood?

651
00:33:57,246 --> 00:33:59,873
-Or Clara, Bournemouth's scandalous…
-Cheers.

652
00:33:59,957 --> 00:34:00,958
Cheers.
