["Hand in My Pocket" playing]

00:00:09,426 --> 00:00:11,470
[song continues through speakers]

3
00:00:11,553 --> 00:00:13,138
Hi, how you doing?

4
00:00:14,056 --> 00:00:15,098
You new around here?

5
00:00:15,182 --> 00:00:16,308
To planet Earth?

6
00:00:17,351 --> 00:00:18,644
No, I'm 13.

7
00:00:18,727 --> 00:00:22,147
But I'm also fairly certain
this is my third life reincarnated.

8
00:00:22,231 --> 00:00:24,066
[whistles] Well, color me impressed

9
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:27,194
'cause my third lap around this big blue
marble I was nothing but a horsefly.

10
00:00:27,277 --> 00:00:29,863
-Oh, I've never seen a horse fly.
-No?

11
00:00:29,947 --> 00:00:32,241
Saw a horse pee once.

12
00:00:32,323 --> 00:00:33,534
That was a lot.

13
00:00:33,617 --> 00:00:35,410
Yeah. Noisy too.

14
00:00:35,494 --> 00:00:36,912
[chuckles]

15
00:00:38,288 --> 00:00:41,667
To be honest, now that
my lower back tattoo's completely gone,

16
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:42,835
I kinda miss it.

17
00:00:42,918 --> 00:00:43,961
-Mmm.
-[door opens]

18
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:47,673
Here comes the biscuits train!
Choo choo! [chuckles]

19
00:00:47,756 --> 00:00:48,882
Sassy Smurf!

20
00:00:48,966 --> 00:00:50,342
-Marlboro Man.
-What?

21
00:00:50,425 --> 00:00:51,343
-[laughs]
-Hey! Hey!

22
00:00:52,511 --> 00:00:55,013
-All right! How about that? Yeah.
-[giggles]

23
00:00:55,097 --> 00:00:56,849
-Here you go, boss.
-Thank you.

24
00:00:56,932 --> 00:00:58,267
Uh, hey, who's the new receptionist?

25
00:00:58,350 --> 00:00:59,893
Oh, that's Nora, my daughter.

26
00:00:59,977 --> 00:01:01,353
Oh, okay. Wait…

27
00:01:04,063 --> 00:01:05,065
Is she mine?

28
00:01:05,147 --> 00:01:07,860
Ted, we had sex like six months ago.

29
00:01:07,943 --> 00:01:10,237
Right, right, right, right. Sorry.
Yeah, bad math. [chuckles]

30
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,780
And if memory serves, you finished on my--

31
00:01:11,864 --> 00:01:14,157
Hey! [babbles] Yeah.

32
00:01:14,241 --> 00:01:16,326
No reason to get into
the science of it all

33
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:18,078
in front of the boss here, you know.

34
00:01:18,161 --> 00:01:19,496
So, uh… [clears throat] anyhoo…

35
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:21,665
What's the hap, Sass?
What brings your fun buns in town, huh?

36
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:26,128
I'm speaking at a conference in Brighton.
So Nora is staying with Stinky here.

37
00:01:26,211 --> 00:01:27,921
Yes, and I am going to make good

38
00:01:28,005 --> 00:01:30,757
on every single one of her wishes
from the last six years.

39
00:01:30,841 --> 00:01:33,051
-Aw.
-Hmm, just make sure one of those wishes

40
00:01:33,135 --> 00:01:35,387
is a spare tampon then,
Miss Fairy Godmother.

41
00:01:36,889 --> 00:01:38,056
-Oh.
-Mmm.

42
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:40,726
That girl is an errant cobblestone away
from her first period.

43
00:01:42,477 --> 00:01:44,563
Well, bibbidi-bobbidi-booyah.
You know. [chuckles]

44
00:01:45,606 --> 00:01:48,358
Always good to see ya, Sass.
[laughs] Straight shooter.

45
00:01:49,193 --> 00:01:51,403
Okay, I'll let you ladies get back to it.
All right? TTFN. Yeah?

46
00:01:52,321 --> 00:01:53,363
Oh, hey, you know what?

47
00:01:53,447 --> 00:01:56,783
What do you say we do what the man says
and make today our masterpiece, yeah?

48
00:01:57,993 --> 00:01:59,661
[clicks tongue] Okay.

49
00:02:02,164 --> 00:02:05,834
-Did he talk like that when--
-The whole time and so eager to please.

50
00:02:05,918 --> 00:02:07,085
Hmm.

51
00:02:07,169 --> 00:02:08,586
It was fabulous.

52
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:09,922
Hmm. [grunts]

53
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:12,799
[theme music plays]

54
00:02:32,611 --> 00:02:34,029
-[male reporter 1] Ted!
-[male reporter 2] Coach!

55
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:36,031
All right, Lloyd, why don't you go
all Pat Benatar on me, yeah?

56
00:02:36,114 --> 00:02:37,908
And hit you with my best shot?

57
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:39,952
-Fire away.
-Yes!

58
00:02:40,035 --> 00:02:43,705
So, you've got Coventry City this weekend,
where you're heavily favored.

59
00:02:43,789 --> 00:02:46,375
You think this'll end your team's
embarrassing streak of draws?

60
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:49,795
Oh, Lloyd, I've never been embarrassed
about having streaks in my drawers.

61
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:52,047
-It's all part of growing up. Yeah?
-[reporters laughing]

62
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:53,340
All right, who else?

63
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:54,424
Yes, sir.

64
00:02:54,508 --> 00:02:55,884
Trent Crimm, The Independent.

65
00:02:55,968 --> 00:02:58,512
Hi, Trent. Make like Dunst and Union
and bring it on, baby.

66
00:02:58,595 --> 00:02:59,847
Hmm.

67
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:03,559
Ted, you're known for creating
a great environment in the locker room,

68
00:03:03,642 --> 00:03:06,895
but do you think the return
of the prodigal son, Jamie Tartt,

69
00:03:06,979 --> 00:03:09,773
will impact that so-called "vibe"?

70
00:03:09,857 --> 00:03:12,067
Hmm. Well, I don't think so, Trent.

71
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:14,570
Yeah. I believe that Jamie's on a path
to becoming a better man

72
00:03:14,653 --> 00:03:16,405
and I'm just here to help him
along that journey.

73
00:03:16,488 --> 00:03:18,782
You know, think of me
as his own personal Mr. Miyagi.

74
00:03:19,992 --> 00:03:22,411
Except without all that extra yard work.
Yeah.

75
00:03:22,494 --> 00:03:24,496
[players chattering]

76
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:31,628
-[Keeley] Knock knock!
-Hey!

77
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:34,006
Sam, I think I have something
you might wanna see.

78
00:03:34,089 --> 00:03:35,090
Okay?

79
00:03:35,174 --> 00:03:37,885
You wanna look at your photos
from the Dubai Air shoot?

80
00:03:37,968 --> 00:03:39,094
Ooh! Yes, please.

81
00:03:39,178 --> 00:03:41,263
Oh, God. I'm very nervous.
But also very excited.

82
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:44,099
That's similar to whenever Colin
drives me somewhere in his Lamborghini.

83
00:03:44,183 --> 00:03:45,934
Aye, it's true.
It's way too much car for me.

84
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:50,063
-Look at you! I mean, come on.
-Oh, wow!

85
00:03:50,147 --> 00:03:52,816
You're a mood.
You're a moment. You're a mantra.

86
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,568
Those sound like compliments. Thank you.

87
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:57,029
Bruh, I'm confused.
Is this an ad for ugly people?

88
00:03:57,112 --> 00:03:58,488
[laughter]

89
00:03:58,572 --> 00:04:01,325
Congratulations, amigo. I can't wait
to see these up in a tube station.

90
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:03,368
-[chuckles]
-Yeah, so I can draw a dick on his face.

91
00:04:03,452 --> 00:04:04,870
-[laughs]
-Ah, yeah!

92
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:06,830
Bro, why you wearing
your kit on the plane?

93
00:04:06,914 --> 00:04:08,457
[players laugh]

94
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:10,626
'Cause it's the only way
they'll know he's a footballer.

95
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:12,044
[silence]

96
00:04:14,838 --> 00:04:17,132
[Thierry] Anyways, man. Um, what are we…

97
00:04:17,216 --> 00:04:19,134
-The pictures are so great.
-Thank you so much.

98
00:04:19,218 --> 00:04:20,844
-Yeah, I'm so proud of you!
-Thanks.

99
00:04:20,928 --> 00:04:22,304
-I'll see you later.
-I'll see you later.

100
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:24,681
Oh, boys. Will you remember to sign up

101
00:04:24,765 --> 00:04:27,100
for that new dating app
I emailed you all about?

102
00:04:27,184 --> 00:04:29,353
It would really help draw some traction

103
00:04:29,436 --> 00:04:31,855
if there were some young,
hot footballers on there.

104
00:04:31,939 --> 00:04:33,023
Yeah, well…

105
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:34,525
Keeley, Keeley,
uh, what was the name again?

106
00:04:34,608 --> 00:04:37,819
Bantr. B-A-N-T-R.

107
00:04:37,903 --> 00:04:38,987
Ah, like Grindr.

108
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:41,949
Yeah.

109
00:04:42,032 --> 00:04:44,034
Well, promise me you'll just check it out?

110
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:45,911
-Of course.
-You're the best! [kisses]

111
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:47,246
-[chattering]
-[Keeley] Bye!

112
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:50,457
Okay, fellas. Got a big game this weekend.

113
00:04:50,541 --> 00:04:52,626
-What are we looking at, Coach?
-Very physical.

114
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:55,045
-Okay. All right. Anything else?
-Borderline violent.

115
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:56,421
[Ted] Mm-hmm. You heard the man.

116
00:04:56,505 --> 00:04:58,632
Still can't believe y'all don't have pads
in this sport. It's amazing.

117
00:04:58,715 --> 00:05:01,343
Sorry, Coach. Um,
do you mind if I say something, please?

118
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:03,971
[stammers] Yeah. No, sure, Jamie.
Come on. Yeah.

119
00:05:05,055 --> 00:05:06,056
Thanks.

120
00:05:10,561 --> 00:05:12,229
I know I wasn't the greatest teammate.

121
00:05:12,813 --> 00:05:15,983
I did some shitty things.
I said some shitty things.

122
00:05:16,066 --> 00:05:19,319
But I want each and every one of you
to know that I'm truly sorry

123
00:05:19,403 --> 00:05:22,656
and I'm ready to do whatever it takes
to make it up to ya. Yeah?

124
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:26,910
You called me a jaundiced worm.

125
00:05:26,994 --> 00:05:28,745
Right, yeah.
And I'm sorry about that, Colin.

126
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:30,664
In a profile for my hometown paper.

127
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:33,125
You hit on my mum.

128
00:05:34,168 --> 00:05:35,294
In front of my dad.

129
00:05:35,377 --> 00:05:38,046
[stammers]
I apologize for that, Bumbercatch.

130
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:40,257
Uh, please tell your father I'm sorry.

131
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:42,301
Um, and give Janet me best, yeah?

132
00:05:43,969 --> 00:05:47,639
[speaks French]

133
00:05:48,557 --> 00:05:49,641
[Ted] Uh…

134
00:05:49,725 --> 00:05:53,270
Oh, he said that you cupped a fart
and put it in his face.

135
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:54,521
[players muttering]

136
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:56,481
Sounds better in French.

137
00:05:56,565 --> 00:06:00,235
Yeah. I know. I do--
I do remember that and I'm-- I'm sorry.

138
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:02,362
Um… Hey, is there anyone else?

139
00:06:02,446 --> 00:06:03,697
You got us relegated, mate.

140
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:05,908
[clamoring]

141
00:06:07,743 --> 00:06:09,536
I don't know you, but I don't like you.

142
00:06:13,707 --> 00:06:14,833
I am not a worm.

143
00:06:14,917 --> 00:06:16,585
Okay. Okay, okay, fellas.
All right. That's good.

144
00:06:16,668 --> 00:06:18,795
Good apology. Way to get the ball rolling.
Okay. Come on, guys. Let's go.

145
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:20,088
Let's get out on the pitch.
Settle it out there.

146
00:06:20,172 --> 00:06:21,924
Let's go, Richmond!

147
00:06:22,007 --> 00:06:23,675
[Ted] Here we go now. Come on.

148
00:06:27,346 --> 00:06:30,599
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay.

149
00:06:30,682 --> 00:06:33,685
[orchestral music playing]

150
00:06:34,311 --> 00:06:36,271
I remember the last time
I brought you here

151
00:06:36,355 --> 00:06:39,483
we played that contest of who could fit
the most little sandwiches in their mouth.

152
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:42,486
[chuckles] Yeah. That was a while ago.

153
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:43,862
[sips, swallows]

154
00:06:45,197 --> 00:06:47,115
[girl speaks indistinctly]

155
00:06:49,701 --> 00:06:52,454
-[Rebecca] Oh, this is silly, isn't it?
-[Nora] No, not at all.

156
00:06:52,538 --> 00:06:54,623
Don't know what I was thinking.
You're not six anymore, are you?

157
00:06:54,706 --> 00:06:56,333
[sighs] It's fine. Really.

158
00:06:56,917 --> 00:06:58,085
Should we go somewhere else though?

159
00:06:58,669 --> 00:07:00,671
-Yes.
-I'll get the bill. [giggles]

160
00:07:01,588 --> 00:07:04,258
Then you're coming back, right?

161
00:07:04,341 --> 00:07:05,425
Yes, why?

162
00:07:05,509 --> 00:07:08,554
Ah, just making sure you're not gonna
disappear for another six years.

163
00:07:10,597 --> 00:07:11,598
I'm joking.

164
00:07:11,682 --> 00:07:12,683
[sighs]

165
00:07:13,225 --> 00:07:14,726
Okay, I deserved that. [chuckles]

166
00:07:18,564 --> 00:07:19,857

-[assistant coach speaking Spanish]
-[whistle blows]

168
00:07:22,734 --> 00:07:26,822
All right, fellas, I think we've all had
enough of this amuse-bouche.

169
00:07:26,905 --> 00:07:28,991
Time to move on to the main course.

170
00:07:29,074 --> 00:07:31,910
-Chef Beard, what's on the menu?
-11 v 11. Let's go!

171
00:07:31,994 --> 00:07:34,496
-[blows whistle]
-[cheers] Let's go! Let's go!

172
00:07:36,081 --> 00:07:38,250
Hey, Jamie. Come here real quick.

173
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:41,587
Yeah, there you go.
Yeah, keep them hips loose.

174
00:07:42,212 --> 00:07:44,089
That's it. Take your time. Love it.

175
00:07:44,173 --> 00:07:45,632
Boy, I wish I could move like that.

176
00:07:45,716 --> 00:07:47,134
-To be so young.
-Yeah.

177
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:49,761
So, hey, we're gonna start you out
on the reserve squad, all right?

178
00:07:49,845 --> 00:07:51,096
No problem, Coach. Yeah.

179
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:53,765
Figure it would be good for the fellas
to see ya earn your spot back.

180
00:07:53,849 --> 00:07:56,435
[panting] Smart. Yeah.

181
00:07:56,518 --> 00:07:59,521
Nothing more likable than watching
somebody humbly overcome adversity

182
00:07:59,605 --> 00:08:01,523
with their effortless God-given talent.
Pow.

183
00:08:01,607 --> 00:08:03,775
Hey, just do me a favor. Don't try to do
too much out there, all right?

184
00:08:03,859 --> 00:08:05,152
I know what you mean, Coach.

185
00:08:05,235 --> 00:08:06,486
Yeah.

186
00:08:08,113 --> 00:08:10,157
Mr. Kit man! Hit me!

187
00:08:11,074 --> 00:08:12,826
-Hey, you think he heard me?
-I do.

188
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:14,828
-Think he gonna listen to me?
-I do not.

189
00:08:14,912 --> 00:08:18,624
-Yeah.
-They are going to kill him. [chuckles]

190
00:08:21,418 --> 00:08:24,671
Sorry. He just-- He just wasn't
very nice to me either, so…

191
00:08:24,755 --> 00:08:26,965
-[Ted grunts]
-[Nathan chuckles]

192
00:08:27,049 --> 00:08:28,550
-Go, go!
-[players yelling]

193
00:08:31,678 --> 00:08:33,013
[player 1] Jamie! Jamie!

194
00:08:33,096 --> 00:08:34,222
[player yelling]

195
00:08:34,306 --> 00:08:36,767
-[player 2] Jamie. Jamie! Jamie!
-Yeah!

196
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:38,018
-[grunts]
-Oof!

197
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:39,937
[player 3] Whoo!

198
00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:43,524
Hey, while you were off
filming your little TV show,

199
00:08:43,607 --> 00:08:45,317
some things changed around here.

200
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,027
Don't bring that weak rubbish my way.

201
00:08:49,738 --> 00:08:52,491
Let's go, boys! Let's go!

202
00:08:52,574 --> 00:08:54,952
Come on, come on! Let's go!

203
00:08:59,081 --> 00:09:00,958
-Hmm.
-[Sam] Let's go! Let's go!

204
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:02,709
Who's the worm now?

205
00:09:02,793 --> 00:09:04,002
It's not me.

206
00:09:05,295 --> 00:09:06,505
Fuck just happened?

207
00:09:07,214 --> 00:09:10,259
We could go and see a show tonight.
What about The Mouse Trap?

208
00:09:10,342 --> 00:09:13,470
You know that Agatha Christie play
where someone dies every performance?

209
00:09:14,054 --> 00:09:16,557
Usually in the audience.
Seeing as only old people go and see it.

210
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,559
-Sure. If that's what you wanna do.
-[gasps]

211
00:09:18,642 --> 00:09:22,396
Oh, the British Girl Shop. Wanna pop in?

212
00:09:22,479 --> 00:09:24,356
Don't really play with dolls much anymore.

213
00:09:25,315 --> 00:09:26,692
No, of course not.

214
00:09:26,775 --> 00:09:30,279
Besides, why do all their dolls
have to be tragically orphaned?

215
00:09:30,362 --> 00:09:32,865
-Mmm.
-Edith's parents died in the war.

216
00:09:32,948 --> 00:09:34,616
-Emma's had scurvy.
-[Rebecca] Yes.

217
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:39,037
The Americans really do the historical
doll concept better, don't they?

218
00:09:39,621 --> 00:09:42,457
Must be their innate sense of triumph,
however misguided.

219
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:45,210
Yeah, but no one does the orphans better
than us Brits.

220
00:09:45,294 --> 00:09:46,712
[bell on door chimes]

221
00:09:46,795 --> 00:09:49,089
-[grumbles]
-Thank you, Uncle Roy.

222
00:09:49,173 --> 00:09:50,174
[door closes]

223
00:09:50,257 --> 00:09:52,009
-I love her.
-Oh, good.

224
00:09:56,221 --> 00:09:57,764
[cell phone chimes]

225
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:21,788
[message chime]

226
00:10:29,463 --> 00:10:32,424
[typing]

227
00:10:48,315 --> 00:10:49,483
[sighs]

228
00:10:55,781 --> 00:10:59,785
Right, so how'd her parents die?
Factory fire? Eaten by rats?

229
00:11:00,285 --> 00:11:02,663
No. Zoe's from the modern line.

230
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:04,665
Her parents were canceled.

231
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:09,044
So, what's happening with what's-his-name,
from the steakhouse?

232
00:11:09,127 --> 00:11:10,212
Who, John?

233
00:11:10,295 --> 00:11:12,005
-Yeah.
-I dumped him.

234
00:11:13,215 --> 00:11:14,842
-'Cause of what I said?
-No.

235
00:11:15,717 --> 00:11:17,845
'Cause you were right about what you said.

236
00:11:17,928 --> 00:11:18,929
So what now?

237
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:20,973
[sighs] Hell, I don't know.

238
00:11:21,682 --> 00:11:24,601
Keeley's got me on that silly dating app
she's promoting.

239
00:11:24,685 --> 00:11:26,728
-The one with no pictures?
-That's the one.

240
00:11:27,437 --> 00:11:31,358
What? So now you just get a bunch
of unsolicited descriptions of dicks?

241
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:34,528
Uncle Roy,
can we have ice cream for dinner?

242
00:11:34,611 --> 00:11:36,029
No, that's dumb.

243
00:11:36,113 --> 00:11:39,032
You're right.
Thank you for helping me set boundaries.

244
00:11:40,868 --> 00:11:44,162
-Wow, she really loves you.
-I know. It's fucking annoying.

245
00:11:45,956 --> 00:11:48,667
[sighs] It's been really gorgeous
reconnecting with Nora.

246
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:51,336
And I had all these things organized.
Loads of activities.

247
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:53,046
She's not interested in any of it.

248
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:57,301
Look, most adults think kids
need to be constantly entertained.

249
00:11:57,384 --> 00:11:58,468
It's bullshit.

250
00:11:58,552 --> 00:12:01,180
I didn't need a fucking parade every day
growing up, did you?

251
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:04,474
Truth is they just wanna feel
like they're part of our lives.

252
00:12:04,558 --> 00:12:05,642
-Hmm.
-Little idiots.

253
00:12:05,726 --> 00:12:06,727
Watch this.

254
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:08,812
Oi, Phoebe.

255
00:12:08,896 --> 00:12:11,356
Do you wanna come
to my podiatrist appointment later?

256
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,900
Yes, please!

257
00:12:20,324 --> 00:12:21,491
[knocks]

258
00:12:22,117 --> 00:12:25,204
Hey, do you fancy
watching a scary movie together?

259
00:12:25,287 --> 00:12:26,455
I can make some popcorn.

260
00:12:26,538 --> 00:12:28,415
Ah, you finally learned how to cook,
did you?

261
00:12:29,708 --> 00:12:31,793
[chuckles] Sounds fun. I'll be right down.

262
00:12:31,877 --> 00:12:32,878
Great.

263
00:12:34,338 --> 00:12:37,925
Oh, and, um,
for tomorrow I was wondering--

264
00:12:38,008 --> 00:12:40,511
I mean, it could be a terrible idea.

265
00:12:41,345 --> 00:12:45,682
Would you want to come to work with me
for, like, the whole day

266
00:12:45,766 --> 00:12:47,768
and just join me for meetings and stuff?

267
00:12:47,851 --> 00:12:49,645
It could be tremendously boring.

268
00:12:49,728 --> 00:12:50,771
That would be amazing.

269
00:12:51,897 --> 00:12:52,898
Would it?

270
00:12:52,981 --> 00:12:55,651
Yeah, I've always wanted to see
what it's like to run a football club.

271
00:12:55,734 --> 00:12:57,194
Really? Since when?

272
00:12:57,277 --> 00:12:59,112
Ever since you started doing it.

273
00:13:00,656 --> 00:13:01,990
I'll be down in a sec.

274
00:13:02,616 --> 00:13:03,617
Okay.

275
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:14,628
-Hey, Shannon.
-Coach Beard asked me to give this to you.

276
00:13:14,711 --> 00:13:16,338
-Oh.
-He had to run off.

277
00:13:16,421 --> 00:13:18,048
Okay. Everything all right?

278
00:13:18,632 --> 00:13:19,716
I don't know.

279
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:22,261
He mumbled the name Jane
and then sprinted away.

280
00:13:22,344 --> 00:13:23,929
Oh, okay. That makes sense.

281
00:13:24,012 --> 00:13:25,305
What about you? You good?

282
00:13:25,973 --> 00:13:27,808
When are you guys
gonna finally win a match?

283
00:13:27,891 --> 00:13:29,685
Geez louise, Shannon.

284
00:13:29,768 --> 00:13:32,396
Not even Beard comes at me
that strong this early, you know?

285
00:13:32,479 --> 00:13:34,398
We like to start off with a little
small talk, you know?

286
00:13:34,481 --> 00:13:36,608
Like, uh, I'll say,
"Hey, what's the word, Larry Bird?"

287
00:13:36,692 --> 00:13:37,693
Then he'll say--

288
00:13:37,776 --> 00:13:41,113
"Don't call me Larry Bird and when are we
gonna finally win a fucking match?"

289
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:44,449
Yeah. Like that.
See, much better. [chuckles]

290
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:50,664
So, being the boss
isn't just about reacting to situations.

291
00:13:50,747 --> 00:13:52,791
It's also about anticipating them as well.

292
00:13:52,875 --> 00:13:56,003
You need to be three, four steps ahead
of everyone else around you.

293
00:13:56,086 --> 00:13:57,171
Good morning, Higgins.

294
00:13:57,254 --> 00:14:00,340
This is my goddaughter, Nora.
She's going to be shadowing me today.

295
00:14:00,424 --> 00:14:02,509
Ah, outstanding! Welcome aboard.

296
00:14:03,302 --> 00:14:06,263
And, uh, Miss Welton,
I received your email.

297
00:14:06,346 --> 00:14:08,932
And once again
your suggestion fixed everything.

298
00:14:09,016 --> 00:14:11,143
I mean, brilliant as always.

299
00:14:11,768 --> 00:14:12,978
What are you talking about?

300
00:14:13,645 --> 00:14:15,397
I was just trying to make you look good.

301
00:14:15,981 --> 00:14:16,982
Eh.

302
00:14:18,483 --> 00:14:20,402
-You blew that. [chuckles]
-Yeah, I did.

303
00:14:22,279 --> 00:14:24,489
And obviously one of the perks
of being in charge

304
00:14:24,573 --> 00:14:26,825
is having your own private sanctum.

305
00:14:27,534 --> 00:14:28,869
Shit!

306
00:14:28,952 --> 00:14:30,495
I didn't think you were coming in today.

307
00:14:30,579 --> 00:14:33,165
When I know you're not gonna be here,
sometimes I use your office.

308
00:14:33,248 --> 00:14:35,334
I like the light
and the absence of smells.

309
00:14:35,417 --> 00:14:38,045
No worries. We had a change of plans.

310
00:14:38,128 --> 00:14:39,713
-Keeley, this is Nora.
-Hey.

311
00:14:39,796 --> 00:14:42,758
Nora, this is Keeley Jones.
Our head of marketing.

312
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:44,968
-Cuppa?
-Mm.

313
00:14:45,052 --> 00:14:47,012
-Hmm.
-I'm so excited to meet you.

314
00:14:47,095 --> 00:14:48,931
I've heard a lot about you
and I love your mum.

315
00:14:49,014 --> 00:14:50,557
She's so cool. [chuckles]

316
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:55,437
What's "Bantr"?

317
00:14:56,021 --> 00:14:59,358
Oh, it's just a little side hustle gig.
It's a new dating app.

318
00:14:59,441 --> 00:15:02,819
This venture capital firm asked
if I can do some freelance PR for them.

319
00:15:02,903 --> 00:15:05,030
Cool. What's the hook?

320
00:15:07,616 --> 00:15:09,576
It's pretty groovy actually.

321
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:12,079
They wanna be a less superficial
dating app alternative.

322
00:15:12,162 --> 00:15:14,331
It's completely anonymous, no photos.

323
00:15:14,414 --> 00:15:15,874
It's all about encouraging people
to connect

324
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:18,043
using their words and personalities.

325
00:15:18,126 --> 00:15:20,045
Yeah, so you don't know if the person
you're communicating with

326
00:15:20,128 --> 00:15:21,547
is remotely fit or not.

327
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:23,173
Horrifying, isn't it?

328
00:15:23,757 --> 00:15:24,842
I think that's awesome.

329
00:15:24,925 --> 00:15:27,219
Yeah, no. Me too.

330
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,972
Cool. [chuckles]

331
00:15:30,764 --> 00:15:33,433
So, I downloaded Bantr last night.

332
00:15:33,517 --> 00:15:34,560
Attaboy.

333
00:15:34,643 --> 00:15:36,270
Hmm, looking for a lady, hey?

334
00:15:36,353 --> 00:15:38,689
Oh, God, no. No, I deleted it immediately.

335
00:15:39,523 --> 00:15:42,693
Besides, I am very picky
when it comes to women.

336
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:46,029
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah. Oh, yeah.

337
00:15:46,113 --> 00:15:47,948
[Nathan swallows]

338
00:15:48,031 --> 00:15:49,825
But women are pretty picky too, so…

339
00:15:50,909 --> 00:15:53,328
Yeah, I'm not really looking
for anything romantic right now either.

340
00:15:53,412 --> 00:15:55,664
But, boy, what if I did get on there
and I met my soul mate

341
00:15:55,747 --> 00:15:57,207
and it changed the whole course
of my life.

342
00:15:57,291 --> 00:15:59,585
-That'd be pretty neato. Yeah?
-Yeah.

343
00:15:59,668 --> 00:16:01,420
What about you, Coach?
You get on there yet?

344
00:16:01,503 --> 00:16:02,838
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

345
00:16:02,921 --> 00:16:05,757
Uh, Jane and I took a big step forward
in our relationship this weekend.

346
00:16:05,841 --> 00:16:07,718
We are now sharing an iCloud account.

347
00:16:07,801 --> 00:16:10,429
-Ooh!
-They call it digital intimacy.

348
00:16:11,346 --> 00:16:14,141
Ooh, so if she found out
that you downloaded a dating app…

349
00:16:14,224 --> 00:16:17,436
She would destroy my phone
with pliers and a blowtorch. Yes.

350
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:19,730
-Ooh. Oh.
-[phone rings]

351
00:16:19,813 --> 00:16:20,898
[Higgins] Hi, darling.

352
00:16:22,149 --> 00:16:23,150
Diamond Dogs adjourned?

353
00:16:23,984 --> 00:16:25,777
-[howling]
-[howls]

354
00:16:25,861 --> 00:16:26,987
[howls]

355
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:28,864
Yeah, I was howling. Like a dog, yeah.

356
00:16:28,947 --> 00:16:29,907
Hey, Jamie.

357
00:16:31,783 --> 00:16:33,243
Hey, how you feeling today?

358
00:16:33,327 --> 00:16:35,537
-Eh, fucking great.
-Yeah?

359
00:16:35,621 --> 00:16:38,624
Yeah, I had this dope idea last night
during me eyebrow threading.

360
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:43,170
I'm gonna buy the whole team PS5s.
They'll fucking love me.

361
00:16:44,963 --> 00:16:48,967
Yeah, but, you know, some folks might also
consider that buying affection, you know.

362
00:16:49,051 --> 00:16:50,177
Exactly.

363
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:52,971
Yeah, what better thing
to spend money on than love? Hey?

364
00:16:53,055 --> 00:16:54,473
[clicking tongue]

365
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:58,310
Hmm, boy. He sure does
thread that needle sometimes, don't he?

366
00:16:58,393 --> 00:16:59,770
[sighs]

367
00:16:59,853 --> 00:17:01,438
Well, gentlemen,
I think we might have ourselves

368
00:17:01,522 --> 00:17:03,899
a "break glass in case of emergency"
situation here.

369
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:07,277
-You know what we gotta do?
-Get Dr. Sharon?

370
00:17:07,361 --> 00:17:09,112
What? No. No, no, no.

371
00:17:09,195 --> 00:17:12,199
No, I think it's time
for these young fellas to meet…

372
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:13,492
that guy.

373
00:17:13,575 --> 00:17:14,785
[whistles]

374
00:17:17,412 --> 00:17:19,414
No. No, no.

375
00:17:19,498 --> 00:17:20,958
Oh, yes.

376
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,544
Oh, yes. Oh, yes.

377
00:17:23,627 --> 00:17:26,463
They don't need to meet that guy.
They don't. Nobody does.

378
00:17:26,547 --> 00:17:27,881
Don't worry, Coach. It's gonna be great.

379
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:30,259
All right. I'll see you in a little bit.

380
00:17:31,552 --> 00:17:33,095
Who's "that guy"?

381
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,305
Led Tasso.

382
00:17:35,389 --> 00:17:36,932
Who's Led Tasso?

383
00:17:38,809 --> 00:17:39,977
The last resort.

384
00:17:41,562 --> 00:17:43,647
Still doesn't really answer
my question though, does it?

385
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:45,482
Who's Led Tasso?

386
00:17:45,566 --> 00:17:49,069
So, our players have contracts that were
signed when we were a premiership club.

387
00:17:49,152 --> 00:17:52,698
But our current income is that
of a championship club. Which means--

388
00:17:52,781 --> 00:17:55,033
You're paying premiership rates
for championship players,

389
00:17:55,117 --> 00:17:56,910
so financially the club's a bit fucked.

390
00:17:56,994 --> 00:17:58,120
[stammers, chuckles]

391
00:17:58,203 --> 00:17:59,288
Sorry.

392
00:17:59,913 --> 00:18:01,206
She got it quicker than Ted did.

393
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:02,457
[knocks]

394
00:18:02,541 --> 00:18:03,584
[Rebecca] Come in.

395
00:18:04,585 --> 00:18:07,045
Sam! How nice to see you.

396
00:18:07,129 --> 00:18:09,339
-I apologize for interrupting.
-[Rebecca] No, please.

397
00:18:09,423 --> 00:18:11,383
Sam, this is my goddaughter, Nora.

398
00:18:11,466 --> 00:18:13,427
-Nora, this is Sam Ob--
-Sam Obisanya.

399
00:18:14,011 --> 00:18:15,262
Hi, Sam Obisanya.

400
00:18:16,305 --> 00:18:18,599
Oh! Oh, yes. Yes.
You guys used to watch Frozen together.

401
00:18:18,682 --> 00:18:20,684
I have now watched that movie
many times myself.

402
00:18:20,767 --> 00:18:21,643
Oh.

403
00:18:21,727 --> 00:18:23,770
It's a beautiful metaphor
for many of life's journeys.

404
00:18:23,854 --> 00:18:25,314
Yeah, especially puberty.

405
00:18:28,025 --> 00:18:29,234
What can I help you with?

406
00:18:30,027 --> 00:18:31,695
Well, um…

407
00:18:33,739 --> 00:18:35,699
I would like to pull out
of my campaign with Dubai Air.

408
00:18:36,867 --> 00:18:37,951
[gags]

409
00:18:38,035 --> 00:18:39,203
What? Why?

410
00:18:39,286 --> 00:18:43,123
Well, it has come to my attention that
Dubai Air's parent company, Cerithium Oil,

411
00:18:43,207 --> 00:18:45,125
is destroying Nigeria's environment.

412
00:18:45,209 --> 00:18:47,794
And at the same time bribing government
officials to look the other way.

413
00:18:49,546 --> 00:18:51,423
I can't be the face
of one of their subsidiaries.

414
00:18:51,507 --> 00:18:53,050
Hell, yeah.

415
00:18:53,133 --> 00:18:55,886
Look, Keeley, I'm really sorry.
I know how hard you worked for this.

416
00:18:55,969 --> 00:18:57,262
It's okay.

417
00:18:57,971 --> 00:19:00,057
[Rebecca]
Of course you don't have to do it, Sam.

418
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:01,433
I'll take care of it.

419
00:19:01,517 --> 00:19:03,268
Thank you.

420
00:19:03,352 --> 00:19:05,270
And, uh, lovely to meet you, Nora.
[chuckles]

421
00:19:06,396 --> 00:19:07,940
He remembered my name.

422
00:19:08,023 --> 00:19:10,484
-[door closes]
-They are our sponsor.

423
00:19:10,567 --> 00:19:13,612
We might need to give them a bell
so we don't ruffle any feathers.

424
00:19:13,695 --> 00:19:14,905
I will handle it.

425
00:19:14,988 --> 00:19:17,991
The CEO of Cerithium Oil
is an old friend of Rupert's.

426
00:19:18,075 --> 00:19:21,245
[inhales sharply]
Perhaps he'll still find me charming.

427
00:19:22,329 --> 00:19:23,664
[grunting]

428
00:19:24,748 --> 00:19:25,749
[growls]

429
00:19:28,168 --> 00:19:29,503
Come here, you.

430
00:19:29,586 --> 00:19:30,879
[yells, grunts]

431
00:19:31,964 --> 00:19:33,131
[grunting]

432
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:38,011
Oh, that's Led Tasso.

433
00:19:38,095 --> 00:19:39,137
Now I get it.

434
00:19:39,221 --> 00:19:41,557
[grunting]

435
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,475
The Ted you know is gone for now.

436
00:19:43,559 --> 00:19:45,269
[grunts, yells]

437
00:19:46,562 --> 00:19:49,189
[blows whistle]
Now listen up, you little turd birds!

438
00:19:49,815 --> 00:19:51,525
Practice starts at 11 o'clock.

439
00:19:51,608 --> 00:19:54,444
If you are not stretched
five minutes early

440
00:19:54,528 --> 00:19:56,488
then you are 45 minutes late!

441
00:19:56,572 --> 00:19:57,906
You understand me?

442
00:19:58,615 --> 00:20:01,034
Do you understand me?

443
00:20:01,118 --> 00:20:03,453
-[Sam] Yes, Coach.
-[Ted] Okay, good!

444
00:20:03,537 --> 00:20:04,913
Now start touching your toes!

445
00:20:06,373 --> 00:20:08,625
Touch your toes!
Those are your feet fingers.

446
00:20:08,709 --> 00:20:11,295
Let's go, dummies. Touch your toes.

447
00:20:11,378 --> 00:20:12,796
And touch each other's toes!

448
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,756
-What?
-[Ted] You heard me!

449
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:17,050
Touch each other's toes!
I don't wanna hear it.

450
00:20:17,134 --> 00:20:20,721
Hands on toes.
Someone else's toes besides your own.

451
00:20:20,804 --> 00:20:22,639
-[Colin] What muscle is this working?
-Don't worry about it.

452
00:20:22,723 --> 00:20:25,976
The only muscle I don't wanna see
working right now is your mouth, Colin.

453
00:20:27,477 --> 00:20:28,896
-[Colin] Rojas!
-[Dani] Yes.

454
00:20:29,646 --> 00:20:31,273
-Richard.
-[Bumbercatch] Rojas!

455
00:20:32,482 --> 00:20:33,483
[grunts]

456
00:20:33,567 --> 00:20:35,027
-Bumbercatch!
-Sorry, Coach.

457
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:36,236
Okay, you're sorry, hey?

458
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:39,698
I know y'all don't think it's a big deal
messing up on these drills.

459
00:20:39,781 --> 00:20:40,866
But let me tell you this right now.

460
00:20:40,949 --> 00:20:42,910
The day we stop doing things the right way

461
00:20:42,993 --> 00:20:46,330
means we are one day closer
to doing everything the wrong way.

462
00:20:47,289 --> 00:20:49,249
Then what happens after that, huh?

463
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:52,002
What, you wanna make, uh, uh,
this ball your girlfriend?

464
00:20:52,085 --> 00:20:54,254
You gonna start taking it
to places under your arm?

465
00:20:54,338 --> 00:20:56,632
Having people compliment
how y'all look together?

466
00:20:56,715 --> 00:20:57,966
And then what?

467
00:20:58,050 --> 00:21:00,844
You start caressing it and playing with,
like, the little air hole nub?

468
00:21:00,928 --> 00:21:03,013
Yeah? Messing around with that?
Making out with it.

469
00:21:03,096 --> 00:21:05,390
Making it your girlfriend.
Is that what you wanna do?

470
00:21:05,474 --> 00:21:08,352
Then when? You ask it to marry you? Huh?

471
00:21:08,435 --> 00:21:10,145
Y'all wanna be married to a ball?

472
00:21:10,229 --> 00:21:11,855
[scoffs] No.

473
00:21:11,939 --> 00:21:13,565
[players chuckle]

474
00:21:14,107 --> 00:21:16,818
-What did you say?
-Uh, I-I said no.

475
00:21:16,902 --> 00:21:18,237
Congratulations, Isaac.

476
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:22,491
That smart mouth of yours just earned you
and the entire team ten laps.

477
00:21:22,574 --> 00:21:24,368
-Let's go!
-Oh, what-- What are you--

478
00:21:24,451 --> 00:21:27,412
Oh! Guess what? Make it a thousand laps.
That's your fault too.

479
00:21:27,496 --> 00:21:29,581
A thousand laps. Off you go!
Let's go. Run.

480
00:21:29,665 --> 00:21:32,709
-What did we do?
-Run, run, run, run, run, run. Run! Run!

481
00:21:32,793 --> 00:21:34,670
Yeah, there you go.

482
00:21:34,753 --> 00:21:37,130
Get them knees up!
Get 'em by your nipples!

483
00:21:37,214 --> 00:21:42,010
I hope y'all drank a lot of water today
'cause y'all are gonna be so dehydrated,

484
00:21:42,094 --> 00:21:46,014
that you're gonna look like one of them
trees from a-- from a Tim Burton movie.

485
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:49,059
I'm talking any Tim Burton movie!

486
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:51,186
Even Dumbo!

487
00:21:52,521 --> 00:21:53,897
Even freaking Dumbo.

488
00:21:55,899 --> 00:21:58,402
[man] Rebecca, what a lovely surprise.

489
00:21:58,485 --> 00:22:00,195
Hello, Richard.

490
00:22:00,279 --> 00:22:03,156
So, are you in your second,
third or fourth house?

491
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:06,994
[Richard laughs] I'm actually back
on the yacht. Care to join me?

492
00:22:07,077 --> 00:22:09,204
I don't think your new wife
would enjoy that.

493
00:22:09,288 --> 00:22:11,790
As long as she can watch,
she doesn't mind.

494
00:22:12,457 --> 00:22:14,918
Okay, Richard, I need to ask you a favor.

495
00:22:15,002 --> 00:22:17,462
One of our players, Sam Obisanya,

496
00:22:17,546 --> 00:22:20,549
no longer wishes to participate
in a Dubai Air ad campaign.

497
00:22:20,632 --> 00:22:23,886
And I was hoping you'd be able
to make that go away without much fuss.

498
00:22:23,969 --> 00:22:27,264
Understood, Rebecca.
That won't be a problem.

499
00:22:27,347 --> 00:22:29,349
Excellent. Thank you so much, Richard.

500
00:22:29,433 --> 00:22:32,311
Of course. And now, darling,
I just need a favor from you.

501
00:22:32,394 --> 00:22:35,314
Okay. But nothing scandalous, yes?

502
00:22:35,397 --> 00:22:38,650
[Richard laughs]
Of course not. Get rid of him.

503
00:22:38,734 --> 00:22:42,571
-I'm sorry?
-Get rid of Obisanya. [chuckles]

504
00:22:42,654 --> 00:22:45,449
Thank you, my dear.
Lovely talking with you.

505
00:22:46,450 --> 00:22:48,327
-It's on the left!
-Richard, Richard, Richard!

506
00:22:48,410 --> 00:22:50,162
-Richard! Richard!
-Right! Right! Right!

507
00:22:51,997 --> 00:22:52,998
Richard!

508
00:22:53,081 --> 00:22:54,208
I haven't seen a pass that soft

509
00:22:54,291 --> 00:22:56,585
since my high school drama teacher
asked me to mow his lawn.

510
00:22:57,586 --> 00:23:01,131
Is anybody on this pitch
interested in not sucking at soccer?

511
00:23:01,215 --> 00:23:03,759
All right, Coach. We get it.
Just stop yelling at everyone.

512
00:23:03,842 --> 00:23:04,843
[stammers]

513
00:23:04,927 --> 00:23:07,596
I don't know whatever this Jekyll and Hyde
thing you got going on

514
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:08,972
but just leave it out, yeah.

515
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:10,974
[laughs] Oh, okay. Okay.

516
00:23:11,058 --> 00:23:14,061
You know what, Tartt?
Practice is canceled.

517
00:23:14,144 --> 00:23:16,438
Hit the showers.
All of you. Let's go. Run.

518
00:23:16,522 --> 00:23:18,357
Jamie just blew
y'all's chance to get better.

519
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:21,193
-Thanks, man.
-That's how running looks. Let's run!

520
00:23:21,276 --> 00:23:23,695
-Let's go! Everybody to the showers!
-[players muttering]

521
00:23:23,779 --> 00:23:26,657
Well, guess what?
We start no people this weekend.

522
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:28,700
It'll be 11 versus zero.

523
00:23:29,451 --> 00:23:31,995
What's the matter, O'Brien?
Your butt still hurt?

524
00:23:34,081 --> 00:23:37,334
Unbelievable. [muttering]

525
00:23:37,417 --> 00:23:38,418
What?

526
00:23:42,214 --> 00:23:43,215
How long was I out?

527
00:23:43,298 --> 00:23:45,092
-Doesn't matter. You're back now.
-Okay.

528
00:23:45,801 --> 00:23:47,386
[Sharon] Well, that was interesting.

529
00:23:48,512 --> 00:23:49,721
Oh, thank you, Doc.

530
00:23:49,805 --> 00:23:52,558
Yeah, little something
we came up with back in Kansas.

531
00:23:52,641 --> 00:23:55,269
-See, what we're doing is--
-You pretend to be an asshole.

532
00:23:55,352 --> 00:23:57,771
So the team make you their common enemy
and not Jamie.

533
00:23:58,981 --> 00:24:01,358
-Yeah. Spot on. Mm-hmm.
-Oh, yeah. Got it right away.

534
00:24:01,441 --> 00:24:02,609
Has it ever worked?

535
00:24:03,318 --> 00:24:05,070
-Uh…
-Uh…

536
00:24:05,153 --> 00:24:06,905
-[Ted] Trying to remember.
-Uh, Chuck E. Cheese?

537
00:24:06,989 --> 00:24:08,073
Chuck E. Cheese. That's right!

538
00:24:08,156 --> 00:24:11,493
Yeah, we were at a, uh, arcade/pizza joint
in Lincoln, Nebraska.

539
00:24:11,577 --> 00:24:14,454
And one of our offensive linemen
got his head stuck in a VR machine.

540
00:24:14,538 --> 00:24:18,000
Ended up getting the entire meal and
all our beverages comped for free, so…

541
00:24:19,751 --> 00:24:21,128
Maybe they don't have
Chuck E. Cheese here.

542
00:24:21,211 --> 00:24:22,171
Oh, yeah.

543
00:24:22,254 --> 00:24:23,714
Y'all might call it
something different here.

544
00:24:23,797 --> 00:24:26,508
Like, uh, Charles Edgar Cheeserton III
or something, right?

545
00:24:27,801 --> 00:24:31,138
-He's a mouse but he's also a musician.
-And he loves video games and pizza.

546
00:24:31,221 --> 00:24:32,431
I'm sure.

547
00:24:32,514 --> 00:24:33,724
-Mm-hmm.
-[chuckles]

548
00:24:33,807 --> 00:24:35,851
Okay, we could release Sam.
Which we're not gonna do.

549
00:24:35,934 --> 00:24:36,935
Oh, no.

550
00:24:37,019 --> 00:24:40,314
Or we can tell the CEO
of our biggest sponsor to piss off.

551
00:24:40,898 --> 00:24:42,524
Which I doubt we can do. [sighs]

552
00:24:43,025 --> 00:24:45,152
Yeah. This is just like the time
I got in trouble

553
00:24:45,235 --> 00:24:47,154
for chewing gum in the bathroom.

554
00:24:47,237 --> 00:24:48,447
You got in trouble for chewing gum?

555
00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:50,991
No, I was smoking.
But I don't want a lecture.

556
00:24:51,658 --> 00:24:53,076
I'll allow it. Go on.

557
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:55,662
I was with my friend Sarah,
who we call "Pimp",

558
00:24:55,746 --> 00:24:57,372
when a teach came in and busted her.

559
00:24:57,456 --> 00:25:00,375
I was hiding in the loo
and I could have just stayed there

560
00:25:00,459 --> 00:25:01,960
but he started to get
a bit shitty with her.

561
00:25:02,044 --> 00:25:06,256
So, I decided to come out and
we both ended up getting suspended.

562
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:10,385
Mum freaked out and I had to watch
a three-hour video about cancer.

563
00:25:11,470 --> 00:25:14,223
[inhales deeply] Point is, Aunt Stinky,

564
00:25:14,848 --> 00:25:19,478
sometimes you have to do the right thing
even if you lose.

565
00:25:20,229 --> 00:25:21,230
Yes.

566
00:25:22,314 --> 00:25:23,732
Yes, you do.

567
00:25:25,234 --> 00:25:26,360
[knocks]

568
00:25:26,443 --> 00:25:27,528
Hi, Jamie.

569
00:25:28,111 --> 00:25:29,112
Hi.

570
00:25:29,571 --> 00:25:31,406
-What's wrong?
-Nothing.

571
00:25:36,328 --> 00:25:39,665
Actually, Sam just quit the Dubai Air gig.
So I'm scrambling a bit.

572
00:25:39,748 --> 00:25:40,916
That's stupid of him.

573
00:25:42,084 --> 00:25:43,335
Do you want me to do it?

574
00:25:43,418 --> 00:25:44,795
What do you want, Jamie?

575
00:25:45,379 --> 00:25:47,965
Well, [sighs] just wanted to talk.

576
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:49,925
About what?

577
00:25:50,008 --> 00:25:52,845
[sighs] I'm just super frustrated

578
00:25:52,928 --> 00:25:55,430
'cause I don't know how to let the team
know I'm cool now,

579
00:25:55,514 --> 00:25:57,599
and it's just really fucking with me head.

580
00:25:58,809 --> 00:25:59,935
Walk with me.

581
00:26:00,811 --> 00:26:01,854
Come on.

582
00:26:03,564 --> 00:26:05,858
I mean, if they wanna be little bitches

583
00:26:06,358 --> 00:26:09,862
about actually having someone on the pitch
who can score a goal, then what?

584
00:26:09,945 --> 00:26:12,197
Am I supposed to just walk around
with me head down?

585
00:26:14,157 --> 00:26:15,158
No.

586
00:26:15,242 --> 00:26:17,327
It's like they're holding onto
some silly grudge.

587
00:26:17,411 --> 00:26:19,371
I mean, it's not my fault I'm special.

588
00:26:19,454 --> 00:26:20,539
[knocks]

589
00:26:21,456 --> 00:26:22,708
-Hi.
-Hi.

590
00:26:22,791 --> 00:26:25,836
Jamie, this is Dr. Fieldstone.

591
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:28,088
She's a brilliant therapist

592
00:26:28,172 --> 00:26:32,050
and, unlike me, she actually gets paid
to listen to you complain.

593
00:26:35,179 --> 00:26:36,346
[door closes]

594
00:26:42,519 --> 00:26:44,062
So, what? Do I just…

595
00:26:44,897 --> 00:26:47,316
sit here and blather on and on
about meself?

596
00:26:48,275 --> 00:26:49,443
Basically.

597
00:26:51,028 --> 00:26:52,029
Nice.

598
00:26:53,071 --> 00:26:54,406
Hey, dick hole.

599
00:26:54,489 --> 00:26:55,908
"Dear Richard Cole."

600
00:26:55,991 --> 00:26:57,993
You creepy old pedo.

601
00:26:58,076 --> 00:27:00,120
"My old friend."

602
00:27:00,204 --> 00:27:02,372
Sam isn't going anywhere, asshole.

603
00:27:02,456 --> 00:27:05,209
"I have decided
not to release Sam Obisanya."

604
00:27:05,292 --> 00:27:07,961
You're a shitty old man
with a tiny, shriveled penis.

605
00:27:08,045 --> 00:27:11,256
I feel sorry for your wife.
Her life must be a constant hell.

606
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:13,217
"Please give Daphne my love."

607
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:15,636
Sincerely, boss ass bitch.

608
00:27:15,719 --> 00:27:18,555
"Sincerely, boss ass bitch."

609
00:27:20,724 --> 00:27:22,851
[both laughing]

610
00:27:25,354 --> 00:27:26,939
Welcome to Soccer Saturday.

611
00:27:27,022 --> 00:27:31,068
We have a massive afternoon of action
for you today across all the divisions.

612
00:27:31,151 --> 00:27:35,489
I'm your host, Jeff Stelling here with
Mr. Unbelievable himself, Chris Kamara.

613
00:27:35,572 --> 00:27:39,368
A man who's coached seemingly
every club in England, including yours,

614
00:27:39,451 --> 00:27:41,036
George Cartrick.

615
00:27:41,119 --> 00:27:43,872
And still getting comfortable
in his new seat on our set,

616
00:27:43,956 --> 00:27:46,959
it's the legendary Chelsea hard man,
Roy Kent.

617
00:27:47,042 --> 00:27:48,252
Welcome, Roy.

618
00:27:50,003 --> 00:27:51,839
-[George chuckles]
-Well said. [clears throat]

619
00:27:51,922 --> 00:27:54,758
Of course,
last time we saw Roy Kent on the pitch

620
00:27:54,842 --> 00:27:58,637
was with AFC Richmond,
battling against relegation.

621
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:01,640
And occasionally against
other Richmond players.

622
00:28:01,723 --> 00:28:03,267
[Arlo] What is this?

623
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:05,477
Kent and Tartt
are at each other's throats!

624
00:28:05,561 --> 00:28:07,563
[George laughing]

625
00:28:08,814 --> 00:28:12,568
Well, the big story today is the return
of that same teammate.

626
00:28:12,651 --> 00:28:15,112
The controversial Jamie Tartt.

627
00:28:15,195 --> 00:28:19,783
The ex-Manchester City starlet
and Lust Conquers All reject

628
00:28:19,867 --> 00:28:22,077
has his first match back with Richmond.

629
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,787
[inhales sharply] Any thoughts, Roy?

630
00:28:24,413 --> 00:28:25,873
Jamie Tartt is a muppet.

631
00:28:25,956 --> 00:28:29,543
And I hope he dies of the incurable
condition of being a little bitch.

632
00:28:29,626 --> 00:28:32,754
-[George laughs]
-Right.

633
00:28:32,838 --> 00:28:34,173
Don't hold back, Roy.

634
00:28:34,256 --> 00:28:36,008
Yeah, come on.
Tell us how you really feel.

635
00:28:36,091 --> 00:28:37,801
Okay. You're a shit manager.

636
00:28:37,885 --> 00:28:39,386
Not about me, you twat!

637
00:28:39,469 --> 00:28:40,888
Language, boys!

638
00:28:40,971 --> 00:28:42,973
-Well, he asked for it.
-He did ask for it.

639
00:28:43,056 --> 00:28:44,308
[Kamara chuckles]

640
00:28:44,391 --> 00:28:45,392
[chattering]

641
00:28:50,189 --> 00:28:51,398
[phone chimes]

642
00:28:58,030 --> 00:28:59,823
[chuckles]

643
00:29:05,871 --> 00:29:07,915
Bantr's horrifying, is it?

644
00:29:08,415 --> 00:29:12,377
I'm going to insult something and then
try it because I'm a good friend.

645
00:29:12,461 --> 00:29:13,962
-[giggles]
-[chuckles]

646
00:29:14,046 --> 00:29:16,048
A-hootie hoo.

647
00:29:16,131 --> 00:29:17,299
Sassy!

648
00:29:17,382 --> 00:29:19,176
I thought you weren't coming back
till Sunday?

649
00:29:19,259 --> 00:29:23,222
What? And miss 22 fit, sweaty men
running around chasing one another?

650
00:29:23,305 --> 00:29:26,099
[chuckles, gasps]
Did you meet Sam Obisanya?

651
00:29:26,183 --> 00:29:28,268
-That's her favorite player.
-Oh, Mum.

652
00:29:28,352 --> 00:29:29,811
[squeals, giggles]

653
00:29:30,479 --> 00:29:31,480
[sighs]

654
00:30:11,687 --> 00:30:12,938
What are you doing?

655
00:30:13,564 --> 00:30:15,065
What, Dubai Air not paying you enough?

656
00:30:15,148 --> 00:30:16,316
[laughing]

657
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:19,486
No, no. Dubai Air is owned
by a horrible company.

658
00:30:20,279 --> 00:30:23,448
One that has turned the southern coast
of Nigeria, my home,

659
00:30:23,532 --> 00:30:26,159
into a hellish, fiery swamp.

660
00:30:28,245 --> 00:30:29,913
I can no longer wear their name
on my chest.

661
00:30:31,456 --> 00:30:32,583
Never again.

662
00:30:39,423 --> 00:30:40,632
Give me the tape, bruv.

663
00:30:50,601 --> 00:30:51,810
Can I ask it?

664
00:31:01,278 --> 00:31:04,031
Hey, listen.
I do not expect you all to do this.

665
00:31:05,365 --> 00:31:08,243
But I hope you understand
why we as Nigerians must.

666
00:31:18,962 --> 00:31:20,088
Throw me the tape?

667
00:31:26,428 --> 00:31:27,930
What do you think you're doing?

668
00:31:29,389 --> 00:31:30,432
We're a team, ain't we?

669
00:31:31,892 --> 00:31:33,185
Gotta wear the same kit.

670
00:31:44,071 --> 00:31:47,741
Live from the Dogtrack,
it's Arlo White here with Chris Powell.

671
00:31:47,824 --> 00:31:51,662
Today Coventry City take on
the home team, AFC Richmond,

672
00:31:51,745 --> 00:31:54,790
who remain winless
with eight straight draws.

673
00:31:54,873 --> 00:31:56,041
Any predictions, Chris?

674
00:31:56,625 --> 00:31:59,586
-Yeah, I think it's gonna be a draw.
-Makes sense.

675
00:31:59,670 --> 00:32:03,257
But the story everyone is talking about
is the return of Jamie Tartt.

676
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:06,426
Chris, will the Richmond faithful
welcome him back?

677
00:32:06,510 --> 00:32:09,847
Tough to say, Arlo.

If no one's passing to Jamie
we can always drop him to midfield.

So the people not passing to Jamie
can be closer to him?

some sort of protest

Go ahead, Gary, what have you got?

Yeah, Ted, did you know the team
were gonna do that?

No, sir. No, no.

But I think what Sam and the team
did today was courageous.

I-I've never needed to have
that kind of courage.

you know?

Sam, do you think that your protest

may have distracted the team tonight
and lead to the loss?

I'm not here to talk about football.

to put an end

the Nigerian government of corruption?
