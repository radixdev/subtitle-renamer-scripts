1
00:00:11,553 --> 00:00:13,138
Hi, how you doing?

2
00:00:14,056 --> 00:00:15,098
You new around here?

3
00:00:15,182 --> 00:00:16,308
To planet Earth?

4
00:00:17,351 --> 00:00:18,644
No, I'm 13.

5
00:00:18,727 --> 00:00:22,147
But I'm also fairly certain
this is my third life reincarnated.

6
00:00:22,856 --> 00:00:24,066
Well, color me impressed

7
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:27,194
'cause my third lap around this big blue
marble I was nothing but a horsefly.

8
00:00:27,277 --> 00:00:29,863
-Oh, I've never seen a horse fly.
-No?

9
00:00:29,947 --> 00:00:32,241
Saw a horse pee once.

10
00:00:32,323 --> 00:00:33,534
That was a lot.

11
00:00:33,617 --> 00:00:35,410
Yeah. Noisy too.

12
00:00:38,288 --> 00:00:41,667
To be honest, now that
my lower back tattoo's completely gone,

13
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:42,835
I kinda miss it.

14
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:46,797
Here comes the biscuits train!
Choo choo!

15
00:00:47,756 --> 00:00:48,882
Sassy Smurf!

16
00:00:48,966 --> 00:00:50,342
-Marlboro Man.
-What?

17
00:00:50,425 --> 00:00:51,343
Hey! Hey!

18
00:00:52,511 --> 00:00:55,013
All right! How about that? Yeah.

19
00:00:55,097 --> 00:00:56,849
-Here you go, boss.
-Thank you.

20
00:00:56,932 --> 00:00:58,267
Hey, who's the new receptionist?

21
00:00:58,350 --> 00:00:59,893
That's Nora, my daughter.

22
00:00:59,977 --> 00:01:01,353
Okay. Wait…

23
00:01:04,063 --> 00:01:05,065
Is she mine?

24
00:01:05,147 --> 00:01:07,860
Ted, we had sex like six months ago.

25
00:01:07,943 --> 00:01:10,237
Right, right. Sorry. Yeah, bad math.

26
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,780
And if memory serves, you finished on my--

27
00:01:11,864 --> 00:01:14,157
Hey! Yeah.

28
00:01:14,241 --> 00:01:16,326
No reason to get into
the science of it all

29
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:18,078
in front of the boss here, you know.

30
00:01:18,161 --> 00:01:19,496
So… anyhoo…

31
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:21,665
What's the hap, Sass?
What brings your fun buns in town?

32
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:26,128
I'm speaking at a conference in Brighton.
So Nora is staying with Stinky here.

33
00:01:26,211 --> 00:01:27,921
Yes, and I am going to make good

34
00:01:28,005 --> 00:01:30,757
on every single one of her wishes
from the last six years.

35
00:01:31,842 --> 00:01:33,051
Just make sure one of those wishes

36
00:01:33,135 --> 00:01:35,387
is a spare tampon then,
Miss Fairy Godmother.

37
00:01:37,639 --> 00:01:40,726
That girl is an errant cobblestone away
from her first period.

38
00:01:42,477 --> 00:01:44,563
Well, bibbidi-bobbidi-booyah.
You know.

39
00:01:45,606 --> 00:01:48,358
Always good to see ya, Sass.
Straight shooter.

40
00:01:49,193 --> 00:01:51,403
Okay, I'll let you ladies get back to it.
All right? TTFN. Yeah?

41
00:01:52,321 --> 00:01:53,363
Hey, you know what?

42
00:01:53,447 --> 00:01:56,783
What do you say we do what the man says
and make today our masterpiece, yeah?

43
00:01:58,660 --> 00:01:59,661
Okay.

44
00:02:02,164 --> 00:02:05,834
-Did he talk like that when--
-The whole time and so eager to please.

45
00:02:07,169 --> 00:02:08,586
It was fabulous.

46
00:02:32,611 --> 00:02:34,029
-Ted!
-Coach!

47
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:36,031
All right, Lloyd, why don't you go
all Pat Benatar on me, yeah?

48
00:02:36,114 --> 00:02:37,908
And hit you with my best shot?

49
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:39,952
-Fire away.
-Yes!

50
00:02:40,035 --> 00:02:43,705
So, you've got Coventry City this weekend,
where you're heavily favored.

51
00:02:43,789 --> 00:02:46,375
You think this'll end your team's
embarrassing streak of draws?

52
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:49,795
Oh, Lloyd, I've never been embarrassed
about having streaks in my drawers.

53
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:52,047
It's all part of growing up. Yeah?

54
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:53,340
All right, who else?

55
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:54,424
Yes, sir.

56
00:02:54,508 --> 00:02:55,884
Trent Crimm, The Independent.

57
00:02:55,968 --> 00:02:58,512
Hi, Trent. Make like Dunst and Union
and bring it on, baby.

58
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:03,559
Ted, you're known for creating
a great environment in the locker room,

59
00:03:03,642 --> 00:03:06,895
but do you think the return
of the prodigal son, Jamie Tartt,

60
00:03:06,979 --> 00:03:09,773
will impact that so-called "vibe"?

61
00:03:09,857 --> 00:03:12,067
Well, I don't think so, Trent.

62
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:14,570
Yeah. I believe that Jamie's on a path
to becoming a better man

63
00:03:14,653 --> 00:03:16,405
and I'm just here to help him
along that journey.

64
00:03:16,488 --> 00:03:18,782
You know, think of me
as his own personal Mr. Miyagi.

65
00:03:19,992 --> 00:03:22,411
Except without all that extra yard work.
Yeah.

66
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:31,628
-Knock knock!
-Hey!

67
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:34,006
Sam, I think I have something
you might wanna see.

68
00:03:34,089 --> 00:03:35,090
Okay?

69
00:03:35,174 --> 00:03:37,885
You wanna look at your photos
from the Dubai Air shoot?

70
00:03:37,968 --> 00:03:39,094
Yes, please.

71
00:03:39,178 --> 00:03:41,263
Oh, God. I'm very nervous.
But also very excited.

72
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:44,099
That's similar to whenever Colin
drives me somewhere in his Lamborghini.

73
00:03:44,183 --> 00:03:45,934
Aye, it's true.
It's way too much car for me.

74
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:50,063
-Look at you! I mean, come on.
-Wow!

75
00:03:50,147 --> 00:03:52,816
You're a mood.
You're a moment. You're a mantra.

76
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,568
Those sound like compliments. Thank you.

77
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:57,029
Bruh, I'm confused.
Is this an ad for ugly people?

78
00:03:58,572 --> 00:04:01,325
Congratulations, amigo. I can't wait
to see these up in a tube station.

79
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:03,368
Yeah, so I can draw a dick on his face.

80
00:04:03,452 --> 00:04:04,870
Yeah!

81
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:06,830
Bro, why you wearing
your kit on the plane?

82
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:10,626
'Cause it's the only way
they'll know he's a footballer.

83
00:04:14,838 --> 00:04:17,132
Anyways, man. What are we…

84
00:04:17,216 --> 00:04:19,134
-The pictures are so great.
-Thank you so much.

85
00:04:19,218 --> 00:04:20,844
-Yeah, I'm so proud of you!
-Thanks.

86
00:04:20,928 --> 00:04:22,304
-I'll see you later.
-I'll see you later.

87
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:24,681
Oh, boys. Will you remember to sign up

88
00:04:24,765 --> 00:04:27,100
for that new dating app
I emailed you all about?

89
00:04:27,184 --> 00:04:29,353
It would really help draw some traction

90
00:04:29,436 --> 00:04:31,855
if there were some young,
hot footballers on there.

91
00:04:31,939 --> 00:04:33,023
Yeah, well…

92
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:34,525
Keeley, what was the name again?

93
00:04:34,608 --> 00:04:37,819
Bantr. B-A-N-T-R.

94
00:04:37,903 --> 00:04:38,987
Like Grindr.

95
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:41,949
Yeah.

96
00:04:42,032 --> 00:04:44,034
Well, promise me you'll just check it out?

97
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:45,911
-Of course.
-You're the best!

98
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:47,913
Bye!

99
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:50,457
Okay, fellas. Got a big game this weekend.

100
00:04:50,541 --> 00:04:52,626
-What are we looking at, Coach?
-Very physical.

101
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:55,045
-Okay. All right. Anything else?
-Borderline violent.

102
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:56,421
You heard the man.

103
00:04:56,505 --> 00:04:58,632
Still can't believe y'all don't have pads
in this sport. It's amazing.

104
00:04:58,715 --> 00:05:01,343
Sorry, Coach.
Do you mind if I say something, please?

105
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:03,971
Yeah. No, sure, Jamie.
Come on. Yeah.

106
00:05:05,055 --> 00:05:06,056
Thanks.

107
00:05:10,561 --> 00:05:12,229
I know I wasn't the greatest teammate.

108
00:05:12,813 --> 00:05:15,983
I did some shitty things.
I said some shitty things.

109
00:05:16,066 --> 00:05:19,319
But I want each and every one of you
to know that I'm truly sorry

110
00:05:19,403 --> 00:05:22,656
and I'm ready to do whatever it takes
to make it up to ya. Yeah?

111
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:26,910
You called me a jaundiced worm.

112
00:05:26,994 --> 00:05:28,745
Right, yeah.
And I'm sorry about that, Colin.

113
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:30,664
In a profile for my hometown paper.

114
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:33,125
You hit on my mum.

115
00:05:34,168 --> 00:05:35,294
In front of my dad.

116
00:05:35,377 --> 00:05:38,046
I apologize for that, Bumbercatch.

117
00:05:38,714 --> 00:05:40,257
Please tell your father I'm sorry.

118
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:42,301
And give Janet me best, yeah?

119
00:05:50,309 --> 00:05:53,270
He said that you cupped a fart
and put it in his face.

120
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:56,481
Sounds better in French.

121
00:05:56,565 --> 00:06:00,235
Yeah. I know.
I do remember that and I'm sorry.

122
00:06:00,944 --> 00:06:02,362
Hey, is there anyone else?

123
00:06:02,446 --> 00:06:03,697
You got us relegated, mate.

124
00:06:07,743 --> 00:06:09,536
I don't know you, but I don't like you.

125
00:06:13,707 --> 00:06:14,833
I am not a worm.

126
00:06:14,917 --> 00:06:16,585
Okay, fellas. All right. That's good.

127
00:06:16,668 --> 00:06:18,795
Good apology. Way to get the ball rolling.
Okay. Come on, guys. Let's go.

128
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:20,088
Let's get out on the pitch.
Settle it out there.

129
00:06:20,172 --> 00:06:21,924
Let's go, Richmond!

130
00:06:22,007 --> 00:06:23,675
Here we go now. Come on.

131
00:06:27,346 --> 00:06:30,599
Oh, yeah, yeah. Okay.

132
00:06:34,311 --> 00:06:36,271
I remember the last time
I brought you here

133
00:06:36,355 --> 00:06:39,483
we played that contest of who could fit
the most little sandwiches in their mouth.

134
00:06:40,275 --> 00:06:42,486
Yeah. That was a while ago.

135
00:06:49,701 --> 00:06:52,454
-This is silly, isn't it?
-No, not at all.

136
00:06:52,538 --> 00:06:54,623
Don't know what I was thinking.
You're not six anymore, are you?

137
00:06:55,165 --> 00:06:56,333
It's fine. Really.

138
00:06:56,917 --> 00:06:58,085
Should we go somewhere else though?

139
00:06:58,669 --> 00:07:00,671
-Yes.
-I'll get the bill.

140
00:07:01,588 --> 00:07:04,258
Then you're coming back, right?

141
00:07:04,341 --> 00:07:05,425
Yes, why?

142
00:07:05,509 --> 00:07:08,554
Just making sure you're not gonna
disappear for another six years.

143
00:07:10,597 --> 00:07:11,598
I'm joking.

144
00:07:13,225 --> 00:07:14,726
Okay, I deserved that.

145
00:07:22,734 --> 00:07:26,822
All right, fellas, I think we've all had
enough of this amuse-bouche.

146
00:07:26,905 --> 00:07:28,991
Time to move on to the main course.

147
00:07:29,074 --> 00:07:31,910
-Chef Beard, what's on the menu?
-11 v 11. Let's go!

148
00:07:33,203 --> 00:07:34,496
Let's go! Let's go!

149
00:07:36,081 --> 00:07:38,250
Hey, Jamie. Come here real quick.

150
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:41,587
Yeah, there you go.
Yeah, keep them hips loose.

151
00:07:42,212 --> 00:07:44,089
That's it. Take your time. Love it.

152
00:07:44,173 --> 00:07:45,632
Boy, I wish I could move like that.

153
00:07:45,716 --> 00:07:47,134
-To be so young.
-Yeah.

154
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:49,761
So, hey, we're gonna start you out
on the reserve squad, all right?

155
00:07:49,845 --> 00:07:51,096
No problem, Coach. Yeah.

156
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:53,765
Figure it would be good for the fellas
to see ya earn your spot back.

157
00:07:54,892 --> 00:07:56,435
Smart. Yeah.

158
00:07:56,518 --> 00:07:59,521
Nothing more likable than watching
somebody humbly overcome adversity

159
00:07:59,605 --> 00:08:01,523
with their effortless God-given talent.
Pow.

160
00:08:01,607 --> 00:08:03,775
Hey, just do me a favor. Don't try to do
too much out there, all right?

161
00:08:03,859 --> 00:08:05,152
I know what you mean, Coach.

162
00:08:05,235 --> 00:08:06,486
Yeah.

163
00:08:08,113 --> 00:08:10,157
Mr. Kit man! Hit me!

164
00:08:11,074 --> 00:08:12,826
-Hey, you think he heard me?
-I do.

165
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:14,828
-Think he gonna listen to me?
-I do not.

166
00:08:14,912 --> 00:08:18,624
-Yeah.
-They are going to kill him.

167
00:08:21,418 --> 00:08:24,671
Sorry. He just wasn't
very nice to me either, so…

168
00:08:27,049 --> 00:08:28,550
Go, go!

169
00:08:31,678 --> 00:08:33,013
Jamie! Jamie!

170
00:08:34,306 --> 00:08:36,767
-Jamie! Jamie!
-Yeah!

171
00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:43,524
Hey, while you were off
filming your little TV show,

172
00:08:43,607 --> 00:08:45,317
some things changed around here.

173
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,027
Don't bring that weak rubbish my way.

174
00:08:49,738 --> 00:08:52,491
Let's go, boys! Let's go!

175
00:08:52,574 --> 00:08:54,952
Come on, come on! Let's go!

176
00:09:00,123 --> 00:09:02,709
-Let's go! Let's go!
-Who's the worm now?

177
00:09:02,793 --> 00:09:04,002
It's not me.

178
00:09:05,295 --> 00:09:06,505
Fuck just happened?

179
00:09:07,214 --> 00:09:10,259
We could go and see a show tonight.
What about The Mouse Trap?

180
00:09:10,342 --> 00:09:13,470
You know that Agatha Christie play
where someone dies every performance?

181
00:09:14,054 --> 00:09:16,557
Usually in the audience.
Seeing as only old people go and see it.

182
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,559
Sure. If that's what you wanna do.

183
00:09:18,642 --> 00:09:22,396
The British Girl Shop. Wanna pop in?

184
00:09:22,479 --> 00:09:24,356
Don't really play with dolls much anymore.

185
00:09:25,315 --> 00:09:26,692
No, of course not.

186
00:09:26,775 --> 00:09:30,279
Besides, why do all their dolls
have to be tragically orphaned?

187
00:09:30,362 --> 00:09:32,865
Edith's parents died in the war.

188
00:09:32,948 --> 00:09:34,616
-Emma's had scurvy.
-Yes.

189
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:39,037
The Americans really do the historical
doll concept better, don't they?

190
00:09:39,621 --> 00:09:42,457
Must be their innate sense of triumph,
however misguided.

191
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:45,210
Yeah, but no one does the orphans better
than us Brits.

192
00:09:47,963 --> 00:09:49,089
Thank you, Uncle Roy.

193
00:09:50,257 --> 00:09:52,009
-I love her.
-Oh, good.

194
00:10:55,781 --> 00:10:59,785
Right, so how'd her parents die?
Factory fire? Eaten by rats?

195
00:11:00,285 --> 00:11:02,663
No. Zoe's from the modern line.

196
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:04,665
Her parents were canceled.

197
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:09,044
So, what's happening with what's-his-name,
from the steakhouse?

198
00:11:09,127 --> 00:11:10,212
Who, John?

199
00:11:10,295 --> 00:11:12,005
-Yeah.
-I dumped him.

200
00:11:13,215 --> 00:11:14,842
-'Cause of what I said?
-No.

201
00:11:15,717 --> 00:11:17,845
'Cause you were right about what you said.

202
00:11:17,928 --> 00:11:18,929
So what now?

203
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:20,973
Hell, I don't know.

204
00:11:21,682 --> 00:11:24,601
Keeley's got me on that silly dating app
she's promoting.

205
00:11:24,685 --> 00:11:26,728
-The one with no pictures?
-That's the one.

206
00:11:27,437 --> 00:11:31,358
What? So now you just get a bunch
of unsolicited descriptions of dicks?

207
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:34,528
Uncle Roy,
can we have ice cream for dinner?

208
00:11:34,611 --> 00:11:36,029
No, that's dumb.

209
00:11:36,113 --> 00:11:39,032
You're right.
Thank you for helping me set boundaries.

210
00:11:40,868 --> 00:11:44,162
-Wow, she really loves you.
-I know. It's fucking annoying.

211
00:11:45,956 --> 00:11:48,667
It's been really gorgeous
reconnecting with Nora.

212
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:51,336
And I had all these things organized.
Loads of activities.

213
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:53,046
She's not interested in any of it.

214
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:57,301
Look, most adults think kids
need to be constantly entertained.

215
00:11:57,384 --> 00:11:58,468
It's bullshit.

216
00:11:58,552 --> 00:12:01,180
I didn't need a fucking parade every day
growing up, did you?

217
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:04,474
Truth is they just wanna feel
like they're part of our lives.

218
00:12:04,558 --> 00:12:06,727
Little idiots. Watch this.

219
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:11,356
Phoebe. Do you wanna come
to my podiatrist appointment later?

220
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,900
Yes, please!

221
00:12:22,117 --> 00:12:25,204
Hey, do you fancy
watching a scary movie together?

222
00:12:25,287 --> 00:12:26,455
I can make some popcorn.

223
00:12:26,538 --> 00:12:28,415
You finally learned how to cook, did you?

224
00:12:29,708 --> 00:12:31,793
Sounds fun. I'll be right down.

225
00:12:31,877 --> 00:12:32,878
Great.

226
00:12:34,838 --> 00:12:37,925
And for tomorrow I was wondering--

227
00:12:38,008 --> 00:12:40,511
I mean, it could be a terrible idea.

228
00:12:41,345 --> 00:12:45,682
Would you want to come to work with me
for, like, the whole day

229
00:12:45,766 --> 00:12:47,768
and just join me for meetings and stuff?

230
00:12:47,851 --> 00:12:49,645
It could be tremendously boring.

231
00:12:49,728 --> 00:12:50,771
That would be amazing.

232
00:12:51,897 --> 00:12:52,898
Would it?

233
00:12:52,981 --> 00:12:55,651
Yeah, I've always wanted to see
what it's like to run a football club.

234
00:12:55,734 --> 00:12:57,194
Really? Since when?

235
00:12:57,277 --> 00:12:59,112
Ever since you started doing it.

236
00:13:00,656 --> 00:13:01,990
I'll be down in a sec.

237
00:13:02,616 --> 00:13:03,617
Okay.

238
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:14,628
-Hey, Shannon.
-Coach Beard asked me to give this to you.

239
00:13:15,254 --> 00:13:16,338
He had to run off.

240
00:13:16,421 --> 00:13:18,048
Okay. Everything all right?

241
00:13:18,632 --> 00:13:19,716
I don't know.

242
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:22,261
He mumbled the name Jane
and then sprinted away.

243
00:13:22,344 --> 00:13:23,929
Okay. That makes sense.

244
00:13:24,012 --> 00:13:25,305
What about you? You good?

245
00:13:25,973 --> 00:13:27,808
When are you guys
gonna finally win a match?

246
00:13:27,891 --> 00:13:29,685
Geez louise, Shannon.

247
00:13:29,768 --> 00:13:32,396
Not even Beard comes at me
that strong this early, you know?

248
00:13:32,479 --> 00:13:34,398
We like to start off with a little
small talk, you know?

249
00:13:34,481 --> 00:13:36,608
Like, I'll say,
"Hey, what's the word, Larry Bird?"

250
00:13:36,692 --> 00:13:37,693
Then he'll say--

251
00:13:37,776 --> 00:13:41,113
"Don't call me Larry Bird and when are we
gonna finally win a fucking match?"

252
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:44,449
Yeah. Like that.
See, much better.

253
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:50,664
So, being the boss
isn't just about reacting to situations.

254
00:13:50,747 --> 00:13:52,791
It's also about anticipating them as well.

255
00:13:52,875 --> 00:13:56,003
You need to be three, four steps ahead
of everyone else around you.

256
00:13:56,086 --> 00:13:57,171
Good morning, Higgins.

257
00:13:57,254 --> 00:14:00,340
This is my goddaughter, Nora.
She's going to be shadowing me today.

258
00:14:00,424 --> 00:14:02,509
Outstanding! Welcome aboard.

259
00:14:03,302 --> 00:14:06,263
And Miss Welton,
I received your email.

260
00:14:06,346 --> 00:14:08,932
And once again
your suggestion fixed everything.

261
00:14:09,016 --> 00:14:11,143
I mean, brilliant as always.

262
00:14:11,768 --> 00:14:12,978
What are you talking about?

263
00:14:13,645 --> 00:14:15,397
I was just trying to make you look good.

264
00:14:18,483 --> 00:14:20,402
-You blew that.
-Yeah, I did.

265
00:14:22,279 --> 00:14:24,489
And obviously one of the perks
of being in charge

266
00:14:24,573 --> 00:14:26,825
is having your own private sanctum.

267
00:14:27,534 --> 00:14:28,869
Shit!

268
00:14:28,952 --> 00:14:30,495
I didn't think you were coming in today.

269
00:14:30,579 --> 00:14:33,165
When I know you're not gonna be here,
sometimes I use your office.

270
00:14:33,248 --> 00:14:35,334
I like the light
and the absence of smells.

271
00:14:35,417 --> 00:14:38,045
No worries. We had a change of plans.

272
00:14:38,128 --> 00:14:39,713
-Keeley, this is Nora.
-Hey.

273
00:14:39,796 --> 00:14:42,758
Nora, this is Keeley Jones.
Our head of marketing.

274
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:44,301
Cuppa?

275
00:14:45,636 --> 00:14:47,012
I'm so excited to meet you.

276
00:14:47,095 --> 00:14:48,931
I've heard a lot about you
and I love your mum.

277
00:14:49,014 --> 00:14:50,557
She's so cool.

278
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:55,437
What's "Bantr"?

279
00:14:56,021 --> 00:14:59,358
It's just a little side hustle gig.
It's a new dating app.

280
00:14:59,441 --> 00:15:02,819
This venture capital firm asked
if I can do some freelance PR for them.

281
00:15:02,903 --> 00:15:05,030
Cool. What's the hook?

282
00:15:07,616 --> 00:15:09,576
It's pretty groovy actually.

283
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:12,079
They wanna be a less superficial
dating app alternative.

284
00:15:12,162 --> 00:15:14,331
It's completely anonymous, no photos.

285
00:15:14,414 --> 00:15:15,874
It's all about encouraging people
to connect

286
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:18,043
using their words and personalities.

287
00:15:18,126 --> 00:15:20,045
Yeah, so you don't know if the person
you're communicating with

288
00:15:20,128 --> 00:15:21,547
is remotely fit or not.

289
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:23,173
Horrifying, isn't it?

290
00:15:23,757 --> 00:15:24,842
I think that's awesome.

291
00:15:24,925 --> 00:15:27,219
Yeah, no. Me too.

292
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,972
Cool.

293
00:15:30,764 --> 00:15:33,433
So, I downloaded Bantr last night.

294
00:15:33,517 --> 00:15:34,560
Attaboy.

295
00:15:34,643 --> 00:15:36,270
Looking for a lady, hey?

296
00:15:36,353 --> 00:15:38,689
Oh, God, no. No, I deleted it immediately.

297
00:15:39,523 --> 00:15:42,693
Besides, I am very picky
when it comes to women.

298
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:46,029
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah. Oh, yeah.

299
00:15:48,031 --> 00:15:49,825
But women are pretty picky too, so…

300
00:15:50,909 --> 00:15:53,328
Yeah, I'm not really looking
for anything romantic right now either.

301
00:15:53,412 --> 00:15:55,664
But, boy, what if I did get on there
and I met my soul mate

302
00:15:55,747 --> 00:15:57,207
and it changed the whole course
of my life.

303
00:15:57,291 --> 00:15:59,585
-That'd be pretty neato. Yeah?
-Yeah.

304
00:15:59,668 --> 00:16:01,420
What about you, Coach?
You get on there yet?

305
00:16:01,503 --> 00:16:02,838
No, no, no.

306
00:16:02,921 --> 00:16:05,757
Jane and I took a big step forward
in our relationship this weekend.

307
00:16:05,841 --> 00:16:07,718
We are now sharing an iCloud account.

308
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,429
They call it digital intimacy.

309
00:16:11,346 --> 00:16:14,141
So if she found out
that you downloaded a dating app…

310
00:16:14,224 --> 00:16:17,436
She would destroy my phone
with pliers and a blowtorch. Yes.

311
00:16:19,813 --> 00:16:20,898
Hi, darling.

312
00:16:22,149 --> 00:16:23,150
Diamond Dogs adjourned?

313
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:28,864
Yeah, I was howling. Like a dog, yeah.

314
00:16:28,947 --> 00:16:29,907
Hey, Jamie.

315
00:16:31,783 --> 00:16:33,243
Hey, how you feeling today?

316
00:16:34,203 --> 00:16:35,537
-Fucking great.
-Yeah?

317
00:16:35,621 --> 00:16:38,624
Yeah, I had this dope idea last night
during me eyebrow threading.

318
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:43,170
I'm gonna buy the whole team PS5s.
They'll fucking love me.

319
00:16:44,963 --> 00:16:48,967
Yeah, but, you know, some folks might also
consider that buying affection, you know.

320
00:16:49,051 --> 00:16:50,177
Exactly.

321
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:52,971
Yeah, what better thing
to spend money on than love? Hey?

322
00:16:56,308 --> 00:16:58,310
Boy. He sure does
thread that needle sometimes, don't he?

323
00:16:59,853 --> 00:17:01,438
Well, gentlemen,
I think we might have ourselves

324
00:17:01,522 --> 00:17:03,899
a "break glass in case of emergency"
situation here.

325
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:07,277
-You know what we gotta do?
-Get Dr. Sharon?

326
00:17:07,361 --> 00:17:09,112
What? No, no, no.

327
00:17:09,195 --> 00:17:12,199
No, I think it's time
for these young fellas to meet…

328
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:13,492
that guy.

329
00:17:17,412 --> 00:17:19,414
No. No, no.

330
00:17:19,498 --> 00:17:20,958
Oh, yes.

331
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,544
Oh, yes. Oh, yes.

332
00:17:23,627 --> 00:17:26,463
They don't need to meet that guy.
They don't. Nobody does.

333
00:17:26,547 --> 00:17:27,881
Don't worry, Coach. It's gonna be great.

334
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:30,259
All right. I'll see you in a little bit.

335
00:17:31,552 --> 00:17:33,095
Who's "that guy"?

336
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,305
Led Tasso.

337
00:17:35,389 --> 00:17:36,932
Who's Led Tasso?

338
00:17:38,809 --> 00:17:39,977
The last resort.

339
00:17:41,562 --> 00:17:43,647
Still doesn't really answer
my question though, does it?

340
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:45,482
Who's Led Tasso?

341
00:17:45,566 --> 00:17:49,069
So, our players have contracts that were
signed when we were a premiership club.

342
00:17:49,152 --> 00:17:52,698
But our current income is that
of a championship club. Which means--

343
00:17:52,781 --> 00:17:55,033
You're paying premiership rates
for championship players,

344
00:17:55,117 --> 00:17:56,910
so financially the club's a bit fucked.

345
00:17:58,203 --> 00:17:59,288
Sorry.

346
00:17:59,913 --> 00:18:01,206
She got it quicker than Ted did.

347
00:18:02,541 --> 00:18:03,584
Come in.

348
00:18:04,585 --> 00:18:07,045
Sam! How nice to see you.

349
00:18:07,129 --> 00:18:09,339
-I apologize for interrupting.
-No, please.

350
00:18:09,423 --> 00:18:11,383
Sam, this is my goddaughter, Nora.

351
00:18:11,466 --> 00:18:13,427
-Nora, this is Sam--
-Sam Obisanya.

352
00:18:14,011 --> 00:18:15,262
Hi, Sam Obisanya.

353
00:18:16,305 --> 00:18:18,599
Oh, yes.
You guys used to watch Frozen together.

354
00:18:18,682 --> 00:18:20,684
I have now watched that movie
many times myself.

355
00:18:21,727 --> 00:18:23,770
It's a beautiful metaphor
for many of life's journeys.

356
00:18:23,854 --> 00:18:25,314
Yeah, especially puberty.

357
00:18:28,025 --> 00:18:29,234
What can I help you with?

358
00:18:30,027 --> 00:18:31,028
Well…

359
00:18:33,739 --> 00:18:35,699
I would like to pull out
of my campaign with Dubai Air.

360
00:18:38,035 --> 00:18:39,203
What? Why?

361
00:18:39,286 --> 00:18:43,123
Well, it has come to my attention that
Dubai Air's parent company, Cerithium Oil,

362
00:18:43,207 --> 00:18:45,125
is destroying Nigeria's environment.

363
00:18:45,209 --> 00:18:47,794
And at the same time bribing government
officials to look the other way.

364
00:18:49,546 --> 00:18:51,423
I can't be the face
of one of their subsidiaries.

365
00:18:51,507 --> 00:18:53,050
Hell, yeah.

366
00:18:53,133 --> 00:18:55,886
Look, Keeley, I'm really sorry.
I know how hard you worked for this.

367
00:18:55,969 --> 00:18:57,262
It's okay.

368
00:18:57,971 --> 00:19:00,057
Of course you don't have to do it, Sam.

369
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:01,433
I'll take care of it.

370
00:19:01,517 --> 00:19:03,268
Thank you.

371
00:19:03,352 --> 00:19:05,270
And lovely to meet you, Nora.

372
00:19:06,396 --> 00:19:07,940
He remembered my name.

373
00:19:09,066 --> 00:19:10,484
They are our sponsor.

374
00:19:10,567 --> 00:19:13,612
We might need to give them a bell
so we don't ruffle any feathers.

375
00:19:13,695 --> 00:19:14,905
I will handle it.

376
00:19:14,988 --> 00:19:17,991
The CEO of Cerithium Oil
is an old friend of Rupert's.

377
00:19:19,117 --> 00:19:21,245
Perhaps he'll still find me charming.

378
00:19:28,168 --> 00:19:29,503
Come here, you.

379
00:19:36,134 --> 00:19:38,011
That's Led Tasso.

380
00:19:38,095 --> 00:19:39,137
Now I get it.

381
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,475
The Ted you know is gone for now.

382
00:19:47,604 --> 00:19:49,189
Now listen up, you little turd birds!

383
00:19:49,815 --> 00:19:51,525
Practice starts at 11 o'clock.

384
00:19:51,608 --> 00:19:54,444
If you are not stretched
five minutes early

385
00:19:54,528 --> 00:19:56,488
then you are 45 minutes late!

386
00:19:56,572 --> 00:19:57,906
You understand me?

387
00:19:58,615 --> 00:20:01,034
Do you understand me?

388
00:20:01,118 --> 00:20:03,453
-Yes, Coach.
-Okay, good!

389
00:20:03,537 --> 00:20:04,913
Now start touching your toes!

390
00:20:06,373 --> 00:20:08,625
Touch your toes!
Those are your feet fingers.

391
00:20:08,709 --> 00:20:11,295
Let's go, dummies. Touch your toes.

392
00:20:11,378 --> 00:20:12,796
And touch each other's toes!

393
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,756
-What?
-You heard me!

394
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:17,050
Touch each other's toes!
I don't wanna hear it.

395
00:20:17,134 --> 00:20:20,721
Hands on toes.
Someone else's toes besides your own.

396
00:20:20,804 --> 00:20:22,639
-What muscle is this working?
-Don't worry about it.

397
00:20:22,723 --> 00:20:25,976
The only muscle I don't wanna see
working right now is your mouth, Colin.

398
00:20:27,477 --> 00:20:28,896
-Rojas!
-Yes.

399
00:20:29,646 --> 00:20:31,273
-Richard.
-Rojas!

400
00:20:33,567 --> 00:20:35,027
-Bumbercatch!
-Sorry, Coach.

401
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:36,236
Okay, you're sorry, hey?

402
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:39,698
I know y'all don't think it's a big deal
messing up on these drills.

403
00:20:39,781 --> 00:20:40,866
But let me tell you this right now.

404
00:20:40,949 --> 00:20:42,910
The day we stop doing things the right way

405
00:20:42,993 --> 00:20:46,330
means we are one day closer
to doing everything the wrong way.

406
00:20:47,289 --> 00:20:49,249
Then what happens after that?

407
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:52,002
What, you wanna make
this ball your girlfriend?

408
00:20:52,085 --> 00:20:54,254
You gonna start taking it
to places under your arm?

409
00:20:54,338 --> 00:20:56,632
Having people compliment
how y'all look together?

410
00:20:56,715 --> 00:20:57,966
And then what?

411
00:20:58,050 --> 00:21:00,844
You start caressing it and playing with,
like, the little air hole nub?

412
00:21:00,928 --> 00:21:03,013
Yeah? Messing around with that?
Making out with it.

413
00:21:03,096 --> 00:21:05,390
Making it your girlfriend.
Is that what you wanna do?

414
00:21:05,474 --> 00:21:07,309
Then when? You ask it to marry you?

415
00:21:08,435 --> 00:21:11,855
-Y'all wanna be married to a ball?
-No.

416
00:21:14,107 --> 00:21:16,818
-What did you say?
-I said no.

417
00:21:16,902 --> 00:21:18,237
Congratulations, Isaac.

418
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:22,491
That smart mouth of yours just earned you
and the entire team ten laps.

419
00:21:22,574 --> 00:21:24,368
-Let's go!
-What are you--

420
00:21:24,451 --> 00:21:27,412
Guess what? Make it a thousand laps.
That's your fault too.

421
00:21:27,496 --> 00:21:29,581
A thousand laps. Off you go!
Let's go. Run.

422
00:21:29,665 --> 00:21:32,709
-What did we do?
-Run, run, run. Run! Run!

423
00:21:32,793 --> 00:21:34,670
Yeah, there you go.

424
00:21:34,753 --> 00:21:37,130
Get them knees up!
Get 'em by your nipples!

425
00:21:37,214 --> 00:21:42,010
I hope y'all drank a lot of water today
'cause y'all are gonna be so dehydrated,

426
00:21:42,094 --> 00:21:46,014
that you're gonna look like one of them
trees from a Tim Burton movie.

427
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:49,059
I'm talking any Tim Burton movie!

428
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:51,186
Even Dumbo!

429
00:21:52,521 --> 00:21:53,897
Even freaking Dumbo.

430
00:21:55,899 --> 00:21:58,402
Rebecca, what a lovely surprise.

431
00:21:58,485 --> 00:22:00,195
Hello, Richard.

432
00:22:00,279 --> 00:22:03,156
So, are you in your second,
third or fourth house?

433
00:22:04,241 --> 00:22:06,994
I'm actually back on the yacht.
Care to join me?

434
00:22:07,077 --> 00:22:09,204
I don't think your new wife
would enjoy that.

435
00:22:09,288 --> 00:22:11,790
As long as she can watch,
she doesn't mind.

436
00:22:12,457 --> 00:22:14,918
Okay, Richard, I need to ask you a favor.

437
00:22:15,002 --> 00:22:17,462
One of our players, Sam Obisanya,

438
00:22:17,546 --> 00:22:20,549
no longer wishes to participate
in a Dubai Air ad campaign.

439
00:22:20,632 --> 00:22:23,886
And I was hoping you'd be able
to make that go away without much fuss.

440
00:22:23,969 --> 00:22:27,264
Understood, Rebecca.
That won't be a problem.

441
00:22:27,347 --> 00:22:29,349
Excellent. Thank you so much, Richard.

442
00:22:29,433 --> 00:22:32,311
Of course. And now, darling,
I just need a favor from you.

443
00:22:32,394 --> 00:22:35,314
Okay. But nothing scandalous, yes?

444
00:22:35,397 --> 00:22:38,650
Of course not. Get rid of him.

445
00:22:38,734 --> 00:22:41,528
-I'm sorry?
-Get rid of Obisanya.

446
00:22:42,654 --> 00:22:45,115
Thank you, my dear.
Lovely talking with you.

447
00:22:46,450 --> 00:22:48,327
-It's on the left!
-Richard, Richard!

448
00:22:48,410 --> 00:22:50,162
-Richard! Richard!
-Right! Right!

449
00:22:51,997 --> 00:22:52,998
Richard!

450
00:22:53,081 --> 00:22:54,208
I haven't seen a pass that soft

451
00:22:54,291 --> 00:22:56,585
since my high school drama teacher
asked me to mow his lawn.

452
00:22:57,586 --> 00:23:01,131
Is anybody on this pitch
interested in not sucking at soccer?

453
00:23:01,215 --> 00:23:03,759
All right, Coach. We get it.
Just stop yelling at everyone.

454
00:23:04,927 --> 00:23:07,596
I don't know whatever this Jekyll and Hyde
thing you got going on

455
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:08,972
but just leave it out, yeah.

456
00:23:09,556 --> 00:23:10,974
Okay. Okay.

457
00:23:11,058 --> 00:23:14,061
You know what, Tartt?
Practice is canceled.

458
00:23:14,144 --> 00:23:16,438
Hit the showers.
All of you. Let's go. Run.

459
00:23:16,522 --> 00:23:18,357
Jamie just blew
y'all's chance to get better.

460
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:21,193
-Thanks, man.
-That's how running looks. Let's run!

461
00:23:21,276 --> 00:23:23,695
Let's go! Everybody to the showers!

462
00:23:23,779 --> 00:23:26,657
Well, guess what?
We start no people this weekend.

463
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:28,700
It'll be 11 versus zero.

464
00:23:29,451 --> 00:23:31,995
What's the matter, O'Brien?
Your butt still hurt?

465
00:23:34,081 --> 00:23:35,290
Unbelievable.

466
00:23:37,417 --> 00:23:38,418
What?

467
00:23:42,214 --> 00:23:43,215
How long was I out?

468
00:23:43,298 --> 00:23:45,092
-Doesn't matter. You're back now.
-Okay.

469
00:23:45,801 --> 00:23:47,386
Well, that was interesting.

470
00:23:48,512 --> 00:23:49,721
Thank you, Doc.

471
00:23:49,805 --> 00:23:52,558
Yeah, little something
we came up with back in Kansas.

472
00:23:52,641 --> 00:23:55,269
-See, what we're doing is--
-You pretend to be an asshole.

473
00:23:55,352 --> 00:23:57,771
So the team make you their common enemy
and not Jamie.

474
00:23:58,981 --> 00:24:01,358
-Yeah. Spot on.
-Oh, yeah. Got it right away.

475
00:24:01,441 --> 00:24:02,609
Has it ever worked?

476
00:24:05,153 --> 00:24:06,905
-Trying to remember.
-Chuck E. Cheese?

477
00:24:06,989 --> 00:24:08,073
Chuck E. Cheese. That's right!

478
00:24:08,156 --> 00:24:11,493
Yeah, we were at a arcade/pizza joint
in Lincoln, Nebraska.

479
00:24:11,577 --> 00:24:14,454
And one of our offensive linemen
got his head stuck in a VR machine.

480
00:24:14,538 --> 00:24:18,000
Ended up getting the entire meal and
all our beverages comped for free, so…

481
00:24:19,751 --> 00:24:21,128
Maybe they don't have
Chuck E. Cheese here.

482
00:24:21,211 --> 00:24:22,171
Oh, yeah.

483
00:24:22,254 --> 00:24:23,714
Y'all might call it
something different here.

484
00:24:23,797 --> 00:24:26,508
Like Charles Edgar Cheeserton III
or something, right?

485
00:24:27,801 --> 00:24:31,138
-He's a mouse but he's also a musician.
-And he loves video games and pizza.

486
00:24:31,221 --> 00:24:32,431
I'm sure.

487
00:24:33,807 --> 00:24:35,851
Okay, we could release Sam.
Which we're not gonna do.

488
00:24:35,934 --> 00:24:36,935
Oh, no.

489
00:24:37,019 --> 00:24:40,814
Or we can tell the CEO
of our biggest sponsor to piss off.

490
00:24:40,898 --> 00:24:42,024
Which I doubt we can do.

491
00:24:43,025 --> 00:24:45,152
Yeah. This is just like the time
I got in trouble

492
00:24:45,235 --> 00:24:47,154
for chewing gum in the bathroom.

493
00:24:47,237 --> 00:24:48,447
You got in trouble for chewing gum?

494
00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:50,991
No, I was smoking.
But I don't want a lecture.

495
00:24:51,658 --> 00:24:53,076
I'll allow it. Go on.

496
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:55,662
I was with my friend Sarah,
who we call "Pimp",

497
00:24:55,746 --> 00:24:57,372
when a teach came in and busted her.

498
00:24:57,456 --> 00:25:00,375
I was hiding in the loo
and I could have just stayed there

499
00:25:00,459 --> 00:25:01,960
but he started to get
a bit shitty with her.

500
00:25:02,044 --> 00:25:06,256
So, I decided to come out and
we both ended up getting suspended.

501
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:10,385
Mum freaked out and I had to watch
a three-hour video about cancer.

502
00:25:11,470 --> 00:25:14,223
Point is, Aunt Stinky,

503
00:25:14,848 --> 00:25:19,478
sometimes you have to do the right thing
even if you lose.

504
00:25:20,229 --> 00:25:21,230
Yes.

505
00:25:22,314 --> 00:25:23,732
Yes, you do.

506
00:25:26,443 --> 00:25:27,528
Hi, Jamie.

507
00:25:28,111 --> 00:25:29,112
Hi.

508
00:25:29,571 --> 00:25:31,406
-What's wrong?
-Nothing.

509
00:25:36,328 --> 00:25:39,665
Actually, Sam just quit the Dubai Air gig.
So I'm scrambling a bit.

510
00:25:39,748 --> 00:25:40,916
That's stupid of him.

511
00:25:42,084 --> 00:25:43,335
Do you want me to do it?

512
00:25:43,418 --> 00:25:44,795
What do you want, Jamie?

513
00:25:45,379 --> 00:25:47,965
Well, just wanted to talk.

514
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:49,925
About what?

515
00:25:50,008 --> 00:25:52,845
I'm just super frustrated

516
00:25:52,928 --> 00:25:55,430
'cause I don't know how to let the team
know I'm cool now,

517
00:25:55,514 --> 00:25:57,599
and it's just really fucking with me head.

518
00:25:58,809 --> 00:25:59,935
Walk with me.

519
00:26:00,811 --> 00:26:01,854
Come on.

520
00:26:03,564 --> 00:26:05,858
I mean, if they wanna be little bitches

521
00:26:06,358 --> 00:26:09,862
about actually having someone on the pitch
who can score a goal, then what?

522
00:26:09,945 --> 00:26:12,197
Am I supposed to just walk around
with me head down?

523
00:26:14,157 --> 00:26:15,158
No.

524
00:26:15,242 --> 00:26:17,327
It's like they're holding onto
some silly grudge.

525
00:26:17,411 --> 00:26:19,371
I mean, it's not my fault I'm special.

526
00:26:21,456 --> 00:26:22,708
-Hi.
-Hi.

527
00:26:22,791 --> 00:26:25,836
Jamie, this is Dr. Fieldstone.

528
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:28,088
She's a brilliant therapist

529
00:26:28,172 --> 00:26:32,050
and, unlike me, she actually gets paid
to listen to you complain.

530
00:26:42,519 --> 00:26:44,062
So, what? Do I just…

531
00:26:44,897 --> 00:26:47,316
sit here and blather on and on
about meself?

532
00:26:48,275 --> 00:26:49,443
Basically.

533
00:26:51,028 --> 00:26:52,029
Nice.

534
00:26:53,071 --> 00:26:54,406
Hey, dick hole.

535
00:26:54,489 --> 00:26:55,908
"Dear Richard Cole."

536
00:26:55,991 --> 00:26:57,993
You creepy old pedo.

537
00:26:58,076 --> 00:27:00,120
"My old friend."

538
00:27:00,204 --> 00:27:02,372
Sam isn't going anywhere, asshole.

539
00:27:02,456 --> 00:27:05,209
"I have decided
not to release Sam Obisanya."

540
00:27:05,292 --> 00:27:07,961
You're a shitty old man
with a tiny, shriveled penis.

541
00:27:08,045 --> 00:27:11,256
I feel sorry for your wife.
Her life must be a constant hell.

542
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:13,217
"Please give Daphne my love."

543
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:15,636
Sincerely, boss ass bitch.

544
00:27:15,719 --> 00:27:18,555
"Sincerely, boss ass bitch."

545
00:27:25,354 --> 00:27:26,939
Welcome to Soccer Saturday.

546
00:27:27,022 --> 00:27:31,068
We have a massive afternoon of action
for you today across all the divisions.

547
00:27:31,151 --> 00:27:35,489
I'm your host, Jeff Stelling here with
Mr. Unbelievable himself, Chris Kamara.

548
00:27:35,572 --> 00:27:39,368
A man who's coached seemingly
every club in England, including yours,

549
00:27:39,451 --> 00:27:41,036
George Cartrick.

550
00:27:41,119 --> 00:27:43,872
And still getting comfortable
in his new seat on our set,

551
00:27:43,956 --> 00:27:46,959
it's the legendary Chelsea hard man,
Roy Kent.

552
00:27:47,042 --> 00:27:48,252
Welcome, Roy.

553
00:27:50,754 --> 00:27:51,839
Well said.

554
00:27:51,922 --> 00:27:54,758
Of course,
last time we saw Roy Kent on the pitch

555
00:27:54,842 --> 00:27:58,637
was with AFC Richmond,
battling against relegation.

556
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:01,640
And occasionally against
other Richmond players.

557
00:28:01,723 --> 00:28:03,267
What is this?

558
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:05,477
Kent and Tartt
are at each other's throats!

559
00:28:08,814 --> 00:28:12,568
Well, the big story today is the return
of that same teammate.

560
00:28:12,651 --> 00:28:15,112
The controversial Jamie Tartt.

561
00:28:15,195 --> 00:28:19,783
The ex-Manchester City starlet
and Lust Conquers All reject

562
00:28:19,867 --> 00:28:22,077
has his first match back with Richmond.

563
00:28:22,661 --> 00:28:23,787
Any thoughts, Roy?

564
00:28:24,413 --> 00:28:25,873
Jamie Tartt is a muppet.

565
00:28:25,956 --> 00:28:29,543
And I hope he dies of the incurable
condition of being a little bitch.

566
00:28:31,170 --> 00:28:32,754
Right.

567
00:28:32,838 --> 00:28:34,173
Don't hold back, Roy.

568
00:28:34,256 --> 00:28:36,008
Yeah, come on.
Tell us how you really feel.

569
00:28:36,091 --> 00:28:37,801
Okay. You're a shit manager.

570
00:28:37,885 --> 00:28:39,386
Not about me, you twat!

571
00:28:39,469 --> 00:28:40,888
Language, boys!

572
00:28:40,971 --> 00:28:42,973
-Well, he asked for it.
-He did ask for it.

573
00:29:05,871 --> 00:29:07,915
Bantr's horrifying, is it?

574
00:29:08,415 --> 00:29:12,377
I'm going to insult something and then
try it because I'm a good friend.

575
00:29:14,046 --> 00:29:16,048
A-hootie hoo.

576
00:29:16,131 --> 00:29:17,299
Sassy!

577
00:29:17,382 --> 00:29:19,176
I thought you weren't coming back
till Sunday?

578
00:29:19,259 --> 00:29:23,222
What? And miss 22 fit, sweaty men
running around chasing one another?

579
00:29:24,431 --> 00:29:26,099
Did you meet Sam Obisanya?

580
00:29:26,183 --> 00:29:28,644
-That's her favorite player.
-Oh, Mum.

581
00:30:11,687 --> 00:30:12,938
What are you doing?

582
00:30:13,564 --> 00:30:15,065
What, Dubai Air not paying you enough?

583
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:19,486
No, no. Dubai Air is owned
by a horrible company.

584
00:30:20,279 --> 00:30:23,448
One that has turned the southern coast
of Nigeria, my home,

585
00:30:23,532 --> 00:30:26,159
into a hellish, fiery swamp.

586
00:30:28,245 --> 00:30:29,913
I can no longer wear their name
on my chest.

587
00:30:31,456 --> 00:30:32,583
Never again.

588
00:30:39,423 --> 00:30:40,632
Give me the tape, bruv.

589
00:30:50,601 --> 00:30:51,810
Can I ask it?

590
00:31:01,278 --> 00:31:04,031
Hey, listen.
I do not expect you all to do this.

591
00:31:05,365 --> 00:31:08,243
But I hope you understand
why we as Nigerians must.

592
00:31:18,962 --> 00:31:20,088
Throw me the tape?

593
00:31:26,428 --> 00:31:27,930
What do you think you're doing?

594
00:31:29,389 --> 00:31:30,432
We're a team, ain't we?

595
00:31:31,892 --> 00:31:33,185
Gotta wear the same kit.

596
00:31:44,071 --> 00:31:47,741
Live from the Dogtrack,
it's Arlo White here with Chris Powell.

597
00:31:47,824 --> 00:31:51,662
Today Coventry City take on
the home team, AFC Richmond,

598
00:31:51,745 --> 00:31:54,790
who remain winless
with eight straight draws.

599
00:31:54,873 --> 00:31:56,041
Any predictions, Chris?

600
00:31:56,625 --> 00:31:59,586
-Yeah, I think it's gonna be a draw.
-Makes sense.

601
00:31:59,670 --> 00:32:03,257
But the story everyone is talking about
is the return of Jamie Tartt.

602
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:06,426
Chris, will the Richmond faithful
welcome him back?

603
00:32:06,510 --> 00:32:09,847
Tough to say, Arlo.
Supporters are a notoriously fickle bunch.

604
00:32:09,930 --> 00:32:11,306
Jamie Tartt

605
00:32:12,391 --> 00:32:15,727
Jamie Tartt
Jamie Tartt

606
00:32:15,811 --> 00:32:18,438
If no one's passing to Jamie
we can always drop him to midfield.

607
00:32:18,522 --> 00:32:21,316
So the people not passing to Jamie
can be closer to him?

608
00:32:32,995 --> 00:32:34,204
-Cheers.
-Thanks, mate.

609
00:32:42,921 --> 00:32:43,922
What's that now?

610
00:32:51,513 --> 00:32:53,015
What's going on here, Arlo?

611
00:32:53,098 --> 00:32:55,475
It appears to be
some sort of protest

612
00:32:55,559 --> 00:32:58,478
against Richmond's sponsor, Dubai Air.

613
00:32:59,229 --> 00:33:01,565
This might become an issue.

614
00:33:14,828 --> 00:33:16,413
Boss ass bitch.

615
00:33:25,005 --> 00:33:27,716
Hey. Easy. Easy.
Hey, take it easy, all right?

616
00:33:27,799 --> 00:33:29,134
One at a time, please. Okay.

617
00:33:29,218 --> 00:33:30,427
Go ahead, Gary, what have you got?

618
00:33:30,511 --> 00:33:32,304
Yeah, Ted, did you know the team
were gonna do that?

619
00:33:32,387 --> 00:33:33,805
No, sir. No, no.

620
00:33:33,889 --> 00:33:36,850
But I think what Sam and the team
did today was courageous.

621
00:33:36,934 --> 00:33:39,603
I've never needed to have
that kind of courage.

622
00:33:39,686 --> 00:33:43,482
'Cause, well, honestly when bad things
happen to people like me

623
00:33:43,565 --> 00:33:46,652
y'all have a tendency to write about it
without being asked.

624
00:33:46,735 --> 00:33:49,071
Sam had to go and get y'all's attention,
you know?

625
00:33:50,030 --> 00:33:53,200
So, if you have any more you wanna know
about it, you can ask him.

626
00:33:53,283 --> 00:33:54,576
Come on, Sam.

627
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:58,121
Sam! Sam! Sam!

628
00:33:59,748 --> 00:34:00,999
Hello.

629
00:34:02,501 --> 00:34:04,878
Thank you. Trent Crimm, The Independent.

630
00:34:04,962 --> 00:34:07,381
Sam, do you think that your protest

631
00:34:07,464 --> 00:34:10,342
may have distracted the team tonight
and lead to the loss?

632
00:34:11,552 --> 00:34:13,719
I'm not here to talk about football.

633
00:34:14,346 --> 00:34:16,473
I'm here to ask the Nigerian government
to put an end

634
00:34:16,556 --> 00:34:19,226
to decades of environmental destruction
caused by Cerithium Oil.

635
00:34:20,601 --> 00:34:22,813
Destruction that the powers that be
have turned a blind eye towards

636
00:34:22,896 --> 00:34:24,231
for far too long.

637
00:34:26,608 --> 00:34:28,150
Do you have any questions about that?

638
00:34:28,235 --> 00:34:30,027
Yes, I do.

639
00:34:30,112 --> 00:34:31,321
Follow-up question, please. Thank you.

640
00:34:31,405 --> 00:34:35,826
Sam, are you openly accusing
the Nigerian government of corruption?

641
00:34:37,995 --> 00:34:39,371
Yes, I am.

642
00:34:39,454 --> 00:34:40,664
Sam!

643
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:50,632
-How are you feeling?
-Good. I think.

644
00:34:51,717 --> 00:34:53,635
I just hope the rest of the team
is not upset with me.

645
00:34:54,803 --> 00:34:57,973
Hey, doing the right thing
is never the wrong thing. Yeah.

646
00:35:00,142 --> 00:35:01,268
There he is!

647
00:35:04,188 --> 00:35:06,398
-What's going on?
-We are celebrating!

648
00:35:06,481 --> 00:35:09,026
-But we lost.
-Yeah, but we broke the tie streak.

649
00:35:12,404 --> 00:35:13,822
A toast to Sam,

650
00:35:13,906 --> 00:35:15,449
who did something incredible tonight.

651
00:35:15,532 --> 00:35:17,618
The little Nigerian prick
stole my thunder.

652
00:35:20,412 --> 00:35:22,289
No, but seriously. To Sam.

653
00:35:23,123 --> 00:35:24,499
To Sam!

654
00:35:25,292 --> 00:35:26,877
-Thank you, guys.
-Well done, bruv.

655
00:35:27,711 --> 00:35:30,255
-I appreciate it.
-Took a lot of courage, man.

656
00:35:30,923 --> 00:35:33,342
-It's good to have you back.
-Yeah, it's good to be back, bruv.

657
00:35:33,425 --> 00:35:34,927
Please don't do this to me.

658
00:35:35,802 --> 00:35:36,929
'Scuse me, chaps.

659
00:35:37,012 --> 00:35:40,015
-Sam, could Nora get a picture, please?
-Hello.

660
00:35:40,098 --> 00:35:41,350
Oh, yes! Of course.

661
00:35:41,433 --> 00:35:44,186
Hey, guys! Guys!
We're gonna take a picture for Nora.

662
00:35:45,687 --> 00:35:46,813
I want to be in the front.

663
00:35:49,858 --> 00:35:51,443
Nora, you all right?

664
00:35:51,527 --> 00:35:53,070
-You okay? Yeah?
-Yeah! Yeah.

665
00:35:53,153 --> 00:35:55,822
-She's gonna absolutely love this.
-Oh, my God. Look.

666
00:35:55,906 --> 00:35:57,074
Love it and hate it.

667
00:35:57,908 --> 00:35:59,076
So cute!

668
00:35:59,159 --> 00:36:00,744
Hide your beers!

669
00:36:00,827 --> 00:36:02,162
Oh, shit.

670
00:36:02,746 --> 00:36:03,747
Thank you.

671
00:36:04,373 --> 00:36:06,291
Greyhounds on three! One, two, three!

672
00:36:06,375 --> 00:36:08,418
Greyhounds!

673
00:36:11,213 --> 00:36:12,297
Okay, got it!
